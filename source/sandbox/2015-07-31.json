I think Matt has chatted with a few of you about it, but the current plan is to set that up where the printer currently is. So, I see sandbox up and running at the moment, can we steal the projector for that luxo setup Monday morning? <@U02613K0X> <@U02618EV1>  let me know and if any questions come up",
