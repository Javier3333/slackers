Will this be the future of sandboxes, digitally enhanced with augmented reality?\nIt’s not actually that hard to set up! The system consists of a good computer running Linux, a Kinect, a projector, a sandbox, and sand. And that’s it! The University of California (UC Davis) has setup a few of these systems now to teach children about geography, which is a really cool demonstration of both 3D scanning and projection mapping. As you can see in the animated gif above, the Kinect can track the topography of the sand, and then project its “reality” onto it. In this case, a mini volcano.\n\n\nFull instructions are available from UC Davis, which is a much better guide than we remember the last time we looked in on this project. Between this and augmented reality pinball, is the future of consumer electronics to cheap out and use AR? Why build something when you can project it?\n[Thanks for the tip Rolinger!]",
