Really amazing to see the product come together on so many fronts — Yes interaction design &amp; visuals, but also tone, point of view, purpose, and opportunities. \n\nI can’t tell you how much I loved the discussion around profile. The debate about white space — really a debate around modernism and editorial voice — was priceless. As you’re continuing work, keep that moment and thought in mind. \n\nAll that said, we have a continued pace we need to keep up today and throughout the week. As you heard yesterday, we have some great momentum. In large part, the most major shifts discussed yesterday were copy changes — Which is amazing! \n\nPlease keep it up today. We have quite a bit to get through, tidy up, and understand for our *Friday delivery*. \n\nAs with my note yesterday - holler with questions, concerns, blocks, etc. More importantly, holler with good stuff too! I know it’s difficult to see the good in the pushes like this. Give props where you see them. And keep in active communication. \n\nI’m here all day if anybody wants to bounce stuff off of me. \n\nThanks and keep it up!",
