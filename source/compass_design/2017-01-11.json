Great work!\n\nI agree with no.1 being the best of them all. \nThe clustered texture is the ‘snow flurry’ ?\n\nMissed earlier discussions here, but I guess it helps to see movement? \n\n_ I think it somehow distracts from the colour changes\nQ1: do you have one with it dialed back a lot?\n\nQ2: where are the stages 30 min 60 min etc? \n_Could you point out the seconds in the video please?\n\nWhen viewing, it is interesting for me to stop the video in those ‘moments’.\n\nIt also helps to speed it up for contextual understanding (and it is getting close to looking like the northern lights “)\n\nQ3: I guess the the colours used are matching Ali’s and Matt’s last designs? Or are they only close?\n\nCheers :snowflake:",

Have not made any recordings of a dialed back version but can put some time into it and see what I come up with.\n\nI’m currently plugging these recordings into my AE files to spit out updates for the InVision prototype, I can also render a video with the UI components and corresponding minute count to complete the context. Related: at some point soon I believe the All Day builds will include the most recent state of this viz so we can interact in real time with it.\n\nColors are open to discussion. I’ve worked with Ali to get them to a good spot but encourage a broader discussion on value adjustments. Because of the blending modes used, values are not strictly adhering to stand alone color swatches. I can get more in depth but it’s likely best served by an in person conversation.",
