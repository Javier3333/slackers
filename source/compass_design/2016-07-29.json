Just so everyone is aware, the plan for the day is as follows: Melodee is working on specing Onboarding while Trent is working on cleaning up the calendar spec and passing off PSD's to Philip and Ali, once that is complete he'll move onto documenting how he sees motion playing out throughout the rest of the App. Ali &amp; Philip are jamming completing the Android pass on all things Disco related as they are already done with their respective sections. At the end of the day we're going to triple check that anything in Dropbox is the most up to date and if not it's marked as pending. \nLeah is working on putting together the Global Spec documentation which should be done by mid day today. Before everyone leaves we'll print out any comps that have changed this week (an example being the calendar view) and replace what is currently on the boards in the social space.",

And of course, an overall brand voice that we’ll need to make sure is intact. \n\nThat’s all probably already accounted for, but wanted to say it out loud just in case. Think the Android process in particular will require significant collaboration between UX, visuals, and our dev teams — so please please please make sure you’re all chatting together. \n\nI know this particular part of the project has been on <@U0261PCRQ>’s mind — so please reach out to her as much as possible (not to sign you up for anything kat!)",
