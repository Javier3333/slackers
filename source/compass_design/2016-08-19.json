        "text": "hey trent. Thanks so much for cranking this out. Think there’s a lot to like here. The way the details expand seems really nice. I think this is a really good study because it highlights the complexity of all of the stuff in play. For me, I think it could be worth experimenting with a version that has a little less overall movement. Maybe we leverage more fade-out \/ fade-in, instead sliding something across the screen. While I enjoy some of the playfulness I see here — the sleep icon bouncing in, and pushing the container down — I wonder if it fits with our theme of daring simplicity. Any other thoughts?",

Re: playfulness on the sleep icon… i think we should discuss objectives on adding new icons. two pieces of client feedback that i’m woking with are Christian’s request for more “fun and playfulness” that we talked about including through motion, the other being Scott’s comments about how they want adding a new activity to be “an exciting moment” (paraphrasing here). the jump up and dip down makes it much more noticeable than a fade in would be, and it has the added benefit of hinting at the summary drawer that users will find details on that activity. it’s a first pass, so i’m definitely open to other ideas on how we want to portray these new activity events",

One immediate thought is that the icon animating in alongside the drawer pull down is sort of two beats (icon = 1, drawer = 2). As I look at it, assuming we do a drawer thing, I feel like it could be a more singular motion. \n\nBut that last part is peanut gallery jerk ewald thoughts.
