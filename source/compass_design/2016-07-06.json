We’ll be uploading content frequently, ideally on a daily basis, to a group Google Drive folder only viewable to those with Uncorked emails and the link to protect the vulnerability of our in-progress work. We’ll also be sharing in this channel quick lists of features we’ve worked on since out last posting so you know what to look for. And as we produce more substantial iterations we’ll be printing\/pinning those to the foam board in Social Space too.\n\nWe hope this will give everyone a chance to be better informed ahead of time, come into visual check in meetings with fewer surprises, and help engage in a more focused feedback loop we’re hoping for to keep moving forward.\n\nHead on over to <https:\/\/drive.google.com\/open?id=0B1KFvQr_SwVvRklOMUE1dEhfb1E> to keep up on the latest (and hit me up if you need access). Thanks everyone!",

I also changed the time picker to be even more custom, I am still working to make it feel more minimal. Tomorrow, I want to finish the time picker and continue on session view screen.",
