        "text": "<!channel> - Big week! \n\nI know we have a day peppered with reviews\/meetings\/discussions on progress. Thanks first and foremost for keeping it up. While I know it’s not been easy, it’s been incredible seeing the rapid work that has been happening on the feature teams. Very very nice work. \n\nAs we track to having designs ready to roll by THIS FRIDAY, I wanted to make sure that communication loops are as tight as possible, especially this week. I have a few specific asks as we go forward: \n\n1) As you know, there’s tons of moving parts across the board. Please please please go to desks, talk about what’s what, ask questions of one another, get out of deck mode and more into human mode. We have such an incredible team assembled here, let’s use one another to keep the momentum going and deliver strong. \n\n2) Selfishly, I’ve REALLY appreciated <@U026E0ZNR> and <@U0MKH0BE0>’s daily updates. I’d love to see the rest of the teams following suit each day EOD. I don’t want to create work for anyone. Just export whatever you have, wherever you are and post an update bullet point style. Peek at what Trent and Melodee have been doing and do that! This applies to all sections. \n\n3) Ask questions &amp; share. ANYTHING you’re wondering about is fair game. Ask your neighbor. Ask a developer. Share with that grumbly person across the office. I know there’s a ton of questions, and sometimes areas that feel like ‘blocks’. No question is a dumb question. Let’s keep this super active. \n\n4) Oh the irony…fuck slack for most of this. I’m typing here for efficiency at the moment. Time is of the essence. Use tools or your feet as you see fit. \n\nThanks again for putting so much heart into this project. I know it’s been a long long long long time coming, and it’s difficult to see the forest\/trees — but we’re on a great path. \n\nI’m here to help in whatever capacity I can. Will see most of you in some official meeting today, and happy to talk in a non-meeting(!!) whenever you want.",
