It is for every project, but we’ve all felt the pressure for Compass in particular. \n\nA few minutes ago, we learned that the Adidas team has decided to push back the initial launch of Compass to March. \n\nThis is welcome news on several fronts, of course. Though I think for this channel it doesn’t change much of how we’ve been operating. We’ve known there will be an initial launch and iterations thereafter. As we’ve been designing everything — including all the research, IxD work, visuals, and production — we’ve built variations on everything (e.g. launch and post-launch versions). \n\nWhile we’re just learning about this shift, I believe the product roadmap we’ve been working toward will remain mostly the same. \n\nThat said, I also think that some of the conversations we’ve had in recent days — such as the onboarding discussion yesterday — may change slightly given more time. \n\nI’ll be sharing as we know more, but wanted you to hear as soon as possible. \n\nThanks as always for being such an amazing team. I can’t overstate that. I know it’s been a complicated project, but our team has delivered thoughtful, consistent work since day 1. \n\nI’m happy to answer any questions\/concerns, and will be working with everybody as we move forward to understand the best way to adapt our workflows accordingly. Come find me if you’d like to chat about anything.",
