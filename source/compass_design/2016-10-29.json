On the week view, can we make Tuesday, June 21 (that's \"today\" in the prototype) reflect the active minute count and activity icons we already are using for the today screen? So 45min and walking, spinning, Dx, and running\n2. On the Dx Join screen, can we switch \"back to today\" to \"back to activity\"?\n3. On the Dx Complete screen, can we switch \"back to today\" to \"back to activity\"?\nThank you!!!",
