Thanks for all your work on them. \n\nRe: milestones, it’s generally recommended to aim for at least 30min of physical activity per day as a baseline. I think that the longitudinal testing will do a better job than any of our guesswork on what the right number of transitions within an average day should be. Like you said, the value is easy enough to change. I would want to make sure that if we do change it (to 15 or 20min, for example) that the new milestone is meaningful in some way. \n\nLooking at my Google Fit data from the last month or so, I rarely exceed 60min on work days, but my weekends tend to be at least 60min, and sometimes &gt;5hrs. When thinking about how we define milestones, we’ll need to find a balance between providing visual reward on the day scale and being able to visualize patterns on the week or month scale.",
