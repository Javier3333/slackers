Curious to hear how you all respond though.\n\nI’d also suggest making an attempt to “ignore” the label after watching it loop a few times to get a feel for how it might recede through repeated exposure.\n\n<https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/vx1llwsqars56cx\/160826_ActivityBar_NewAddition_Multi_01.mov?dl=0>\n<https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/w4zzhpkk3yom6fm\/160826_ActivityBar_NewAddition_Multi_02.mov?dl=0>\n<https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/a211to8m8aqzq1b\/160826_ActivityBar_NewAddition_Multi_03.mov?dl=0>",
