The first couple pages outline the content\/intentions of the day view and month view. Following those pages are the two options I mentioned. The solution may lie somewhere in between, who knows. Option A: The hero visualization shows just activity and workouts, there’s a separate visualization for sleep data, and discovery activities live at the bottom of the page. Option A Month view, same thing.  Option B: The visual team comes up with a successful visualization that incorporates activity, sleep (even high level) and discovery activities. Depending on what section you’re in, Activity, Sleep, or Discovery data will be “highlighted” in the visualization. Option B Month View: I dont know if this is even feasible, but is there a way to show activity and sleep (and discoveries?) in a single month visualization without having it be totally insane? If not, we can always go Option A for month view.",

Following those pages are the two options I mentioned. The solution may lie somewhere in between, who knows. Option A: The hero visualization shows just activity and workouts, there’s a separate visualization for sleep data, and discovery activities live at the bottom of the page. Option A Month view, same thing.  Option B: The visual team comes up with a successful visualization that incorporates activity, sleep (even high level) and discovery activities. Depending on what section you’re in, Activity, Sleep, or Discovery data will be “highlighted” in the visualization. Option B Month View: I dont know if this is even feasible, but is there a way to show activity and sleep (and discoveries?) in a single month visualization without having it be totally insane? If not, we can always go Option A for month view."
