Each one currently takes 30 minutes of activity to arrive at, which is a nice clean number to divide them up with. \n\nIf we find that too many users struggle to make it out of the 2nd or 3rd milestone, would we be open to adjusting the scale for easier progression? And if so, are there any proposals for what the new increment would be per milestone?",
