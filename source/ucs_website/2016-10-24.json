When the city is fat with foreign dignitaries, world leaders and media, a whole host of conferences and summits pop-up around the core event, taking advantage of the microcosm of political consciousness and celebrity. Despite the unpleasantries, like horrific traffic, and well, that one bombing incident, it was amazing brain food and we’re proud to have taken part in several events the past few days.",
