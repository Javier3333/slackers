Update from me: \n\n• Here for help\/support\/etc. as needed. \n• Wondering what, if anything, we're doing for this week's review\n• I'd love to start figuring out some sort of tangible way to talk about this with Nike folks. The work we've been doing has been a mix of visible and invisible to client. Would love to be able to start mapping back to something tangible. \n• Need to figure out any missing pieces. Icon? Default screen? Think we're in pretty decent shape, but want to make sure.",
