UPDATE 12\/3\/15 5pm et The cutouts for USB ports and miniHDMI has been opened up (0.2mm on each side) to accommodate for cables with larger connectors. The recessed area has been removed. The cutout for the SD card has been reduced and removed from the cover part. The inner lip of the cover was reduced 0.1mm to accommodate for the tight tolerance. This is a simple enclosure for the Raspberry Pi Zero. It's a two piece design that features cutouts for the GPIO, microUSB, mini HDMI and microSD card. The Raspberry Pi Zero PCB snap fits into the enclosure with no need for machine screws. The cover also has a snap fit. Designed by Noe Ruiz.
