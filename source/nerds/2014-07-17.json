Sure there's some suspension of disbelief in there, but my guess is that batman would be subdued basically on the same day that he appeared. By police. Gotham city is CRAZY population dense (only smaller than Metropolis) - the biggest hole in that guy's theory is around tracking the batmobile. You wouldn't really need to do much more than fake a bank robbery to catch the guy before the supervillians showed up",
