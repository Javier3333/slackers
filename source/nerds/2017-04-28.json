                "text": "A variety of explanatory pamphlets were published by the Rural Electrification Office (REO) in the 1940s, 50s and 60s to educate the Irish public. By addressing contemporary concerns and priorities relating to the installation, cost and benefits of electricity, they offer a unique insight into life in rural Ireland &ndash; a life that was undergoing rapid change.\nWe have digitised a number of surviving rural pamphlets to create the below library.\nThe above photograph shows a selection of rural pamphlets on display in January 1956.\nRural pamphlet library\n\n\n\nThis pamphlet, &lsquo;How you can get electricity to your rural home&rsquo;, is one of our key surviving documents from the Rural Electrification Office.\nIt gives us an excellent introduction to how the Rural Electrification Scheme worked, while the rest of the pamphlets in the library below outline a range of benefits on the farm and in the rural home.\nClick on any pamphlet cover in this library to open, or to download PDF.",
