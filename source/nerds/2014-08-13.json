Nobody really wants to sit through an hour of video of you heading up and down the slopes, however. You could just speed these videos up, but then they become completely unwatchable.\r\n\r\nThanks to a new Microsoft Research project, however, you may soon be able to turn those long boring first-person videos into really smooth hyperlapse sequences that run at 10x the speed of the original video but don't make you want to throw up because of the camera shake.",
