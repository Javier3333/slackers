                "text": "A hand-made telegraph key that acts as a fully-functioning USB keyboard. The perfect gift for someone trying to learn morse code, or simply a fan of history! This key contains custom electronics to interface with any computer or device that can recognize a standard USB keyboard, no software needed. Each telegraph key is hand-made in the United States out of your choice of solid all-natural wood. The telegraph key has three different modes of operation you can switch between. * In the default mode, tapping out valid morse characters types the corresponding numbers and letters. If you tap ... --- ..., for example, your computer will act as if you typed the letters sos. * If you want to practice communicating with your friends, the key can send raw dot (.) and dash (-) characters. * If you use existing morse code training tools such as <http:\/\/morsecode.me>, the key can simply act as an extra space bar. You can switch between these modes at will, as well as easily adjust the input speed. Each key is approximately 7 x 3.5 x 2, weighs about 7 oz, and comes with a 5-foot USB cable. If youre a hobbyist yourself, its fully disassemblable, and uses an Arduino-compatible microcontroller for easy tinkerability.",
