        "text": "Another key difference between US and UK chocolate is that much US chocolate uses milk that has undergone lipolysis, a process that partially breaks down the fatty acids in milk. This is another historical anomaly in the evolution of chocolate production. In the early 20th century, the process of partially souring milk through lipolysis was used to stabilize milk chocolate, as the resulting milk chocolate could be stored for longer periods of time before its taste changed for the worse. (There's a patent on record from 1930 that describes the process:  <http:\/\/www.google.com\/patents?id...>) The advantage of the process is that further breakdown of fats in milk is slowed, and subsequent fermentation is reduced. The \"milk\" taste also lasts longer, before either fading or turning into bad-tasting compounds. The down-side is that the process releases butyric acid, one of the fatty acids present in milk. Butyric acid is the fat component responsible for the smell of parmesan cheese and baby vomit. (Yes, you might view the definition of \"bad-tasting\" as being a bit flexible!)",
