It is a jeopardy style CTF, where the participating teams need to solve security related challenges in various categories such as exploitation, reverse engineering, web, forensic &amp; crypto. CTF is fun and educational, and I definitely recommend participating in it. It's even more fun when you win, like we did this year!",
