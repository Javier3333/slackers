Darth Vader.\nThe detention of the erstwhile companion of smuggler-turned-hero Han Solo, who appears to have turned to the Dark Side, happened in the port city of Odessa. Chewbacca drove Darth Vader to a polling station, but police arrested him for violating a law that forbids campaigning on election day. They were also dismayed when he failed to produce a valid ID, and resisted arrest.\n\nChewbacca later told the media that he was unable to pay the fine 170 hryvna fine \"as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet.\"",
