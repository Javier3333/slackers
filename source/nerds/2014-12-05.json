Similar colors–glossy teal and purple–streak the brown hair of the young woman who types alternately at a desktop and laptop, both adorned with images of galaxies. Strewn around her desk are tins of tea and half-rolled posters showing illustrations of what look like virtual donuts. Avani Wildani, a computer scientist in the Computational Neurobiology Laboratory under Tatyana Sharpee, is constructing geometric forms from massive amounts of biological data, with the hopes of finding large-scale patterns in nature. By constraining the data in three-dimensional space, representations emerge–shapes like donuts and spheres–that can lead to a better understanding of complex processes. “I was always interested in what information means for the min",
