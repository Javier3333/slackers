                "text": "The Othermill is a portable, computer controlled (CNC), 3-axis mill specifically designed for small workspaces. Our mill is compact, clean, and quiet enough for use at home, yet produces professional-quality work in metals, woods, waxes, and plastics. The Othermill will be at home on your desk, in your workshop, or on your kitchen table.   The Othermill is available exclusively in the USA. We will be expanding into international sales as soon as we can. To be notified when international shipping begins, please sign up below.     What are the system requirements for the Othermill? Otherplan , our “what you see is what you make” milling software that guides you through the milling process, runs on Mac OS X 10.8 or higher.   What file formats does Otherplan support? Eagle: .brd Gerber: .gtl and .grb G-Code: .nc and .tap   What other file formats will Otherplan support in the future? We plan to support other types of .svg files, as well as .dxf, .stl, and .obj. As we integrate these new filetypes, we’ll automatically share these free updates with all Otherplan users.   How fast can the Othermill go? The maximum traverse speed (rapid) is 1,000 mm\/min and the maximum spindle speed is 12,000 rpm. Otherplan will help you set the optimal cutting speed based on the materials and tools you use.   The Othermill includes a 90-day warranty . For more information on the Othermill, please see the Othermill Overview page .",
