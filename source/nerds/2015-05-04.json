                "text": "Nikola Tesla pioneered the transmission of electricity over wires. Heinrich Hertz proved it could be transmitted wirelessly. But we still use 19th centre technology to power 21st century devices. \nNikola Labs — which pitched today on stage after being selected by TechCrunch Editorial and the audience as the ‘Wildcard’ choice from Startup Alley  — launched a device which converts radio frequencies into DC power, and – they laim, can therefore power devices. \nToday they launched their first product using the technology. A case for an iPhone 6. It converts the wasted 90% of energy the phone produces in trying to pump out a cellphone signal, and puts it back into the phone, thus powering the phone for up to 30% longer. \nNote: This is not an extra battery, it simply works passively. Essentially it is harvesting back the ambient RF energy already being produced by the phone. \nThey aim to bring the product to market within one year, in partnership with the Ohio State University, where the technology was originally developed, and from there they have licensed the technology and patents.\nThey could also put this into many different devices such as wearable technology, embedded sensors, medical devices, and the internet of things. Anything which doesn’t require massive amounts of electricity.\nIt will be launching on Kickstarter in one month for $99, and they hope to ship it inside the following 4 months. \nAppropriately, Nikola Labs launched its product in the very building Tesla himself lived and eventually died in.",
