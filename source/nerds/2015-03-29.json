A Raspberry Pi powered portable emulation machine. Now you can take your retro gaming anywhere you go (so long as you have a pouch to carry this little Beast :P). The specs are as follows: *Processor: 512 Mb Raspberry Pi Model B *Display: 4.5\" TFT Monitor *Battery: 9.6v NiMh Pack *Controls: Custom, running on Teensy 2.0 (Joystick, four action buttons, start\/select, and two shoulder buttons) *Sound: 2 Mini 8 Ohm speakers running mono, or a stereo 3.5mm headphone jack *Operating system: [RetroPie](<http:\/\/blog.petrockblock.com\/retropie>) (Please see the bill of materials under 'instructions' for a detailed list) [Here](<http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/EDMEs#0>) is a nice album full of detail shots. [THIS](<http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/8ltCe#0>) album offers nice detail shots of the interior. A much larger construction album as well as a work in progress bill of materials can be found under 'instructions'. My submission here is currently a work in progress and I hope to finish the bill of material as well as offer a schematic very soon. As I stated in the instructions there was a lot of frustration involved in this project that pictures and spread sheets can't communicate. My advice would be to use what I have uploaded as inspiration for a project of your own. I hope you enjoy :) EDIT: A video of the unit in action can be found [HERE](<https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9xu7DCyLcSs>) P.S. I would like to give a nice shout out to Ben Heck. If you have a chance look him up on Youtube. His portable raspberry pi project (featured on this very [SITE](<http:\/\/www.thingiverse.com\/thing:110354>)) was the inspiration for my project.",
