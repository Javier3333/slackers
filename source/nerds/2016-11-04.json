Instead of a shiny cylinder, why can&rsquo;t you be a singing fish?&rdquo;\nGood news, friend. Your dreams have come true.\nOn his Facebook profile, artist Brian Krane briefly demonstrates what happens when you take one of those oh-so-classy singing fish &mdash; &ldquo;Big Mouth Billy Bass&rdquo;, as it&rsquo;s known amongst those of us who saw the commercial 47,000 times in the early 2000s &mdash; and wire it up to be a scaled rubber embodiment of Amazon&rsquo;s personal voice assistant.\nWant one of your own? Of course you do.\nAlas, the creator didn&rsquo;t shed too much light on how it all works. Is it a Raspberry Pi running Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa API? Or is it an Amazon Echo, gutted and stuffed into the fish, its every word converted into a twitch of Billy&rsquo;s motorized muscles? That&rsquo;s up to you to figure out, for now.",
