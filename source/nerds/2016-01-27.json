                "text": "This is a mechanical watch with tourbillon and going barrel. The watch has a Swiss lever escapement, embedded in the tourbillon. It is driven by a 3d-printed spring, and runs 35 Minutes (a wire retraction spring made from steel would perform better). My watch is running with less than 0.5 Seconds deviation within one Minute. The project demonstrates that the 3D-printing technology is developing. Compared with earlier generations of 3d-printers, the process works more reliable and more accurately. The watch is designed with Autodesk Fusion 360, and printed with Ultimaker 2. How it's made: <https:\/\/youtu.be\/Go8woPGOggg> Assembly Animation: <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XiZAEaES2Ng> Assembly Time Lapse: <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=s3p25T6YlQc> Autodesk Fusion 360 Design: <http:\/\/a360.co\/1S4wp4W> Many thanks to Nicholas Manousos for his great article in HODINKEE explaining the importance of my project from a watchmakers perspective. His first 3d-printed Tourbillon 1000% was also a source of inspiration for my work.",
