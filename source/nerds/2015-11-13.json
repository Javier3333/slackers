                "text": "A team of scientists from the University of Warwick say they have made the “first weather map” of a planet outside the Solar System. Called HD 189733b, the exoplanet is located about 63 light-years from Earth, and appears to have wind speeds of 8,690 kilometers (5,400 miles) per hour blowing from its day to its night side – west to east. That’s more than two kilometers (1.2 miles) per second, and is 20 times quicker than the fastest winds on Earth.",
