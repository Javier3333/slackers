However, BNNS doesn’t offer back propagation (the ability for the neural net to learn) ], while TenserFlow (Google’s open source nueral net) does. However, tenser flow isn’t able to access Apple’s GPUs because Apple devices do not use Nvidia GPUs. Here is a blog post on how to export weights from Tensorflow into BNNS. <https:\/\/www.bignerdranch.com\/blog\/use-tensorflow-and-bnns-to-add-machine-learning-to-your-mac-or-ios-app\/>",
