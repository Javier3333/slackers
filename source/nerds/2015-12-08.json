Through architectural transformations of media wall located in 350 Mission’ lobby, home of Salesforce, main motivation with this seminal media architecture approach is to frame this experience with a meticulously abstract and cinematic site-specific data-driven narration. As a result, this media wall turns into a spectacular public event making direct and phantasmagorical connections to its surroundings through simultaneous juxtapositions. The project also intends to contribute to contemporary discourse of public art by proposing a hybrid blend of media arts and architecture in 21st century.\n\nWhen creating this public artwork my goal was to make the invisible visible by embedding media arts into architecture to create a new way to experience a living urban space.\n_\nMedium: 6mm LED Media Wall\nDimensions: 20' x 40'\nCustom Software (VVVV), 90 minutes long dynamic visual experience in 12 chapters.\n8 Channel sound.\n_\nShot ,edit and color-correction: Refik Anadol\nMusic: Goldmund - Threnody (Unseen-Music)\nSound Design: Kerim Karaoglu\n_\n<http:\/\/www.refikanadol.com\/works\/virtual-depictions-san-francisco\/>\n\n_\nCREDITS\nVirtual Depictions: San Francisco By Refik Anadol\n_\nCommissioned by: Kilroy Realty Corporation\nJohn B.

                "text": "Farewell Firefox OS smartphones. Mozilla today announced an end to its smartphone experiment, and said that it would stop developing and selling Firefox OS smartphones. It will continue to experiment on how it might work on other connected devices and Internet of Things networks.\nThe announcement was made earlier today at Mozilla’s developer event in Orlando, “Mozlando“, and several people were tweeting the basics of the news. Now Mozilla has provided us with a full statement from Ari Jaaksi, Mozilla’s SVP of Connected Devices.\n“We are proud of the benefits Firefox OS added to the Web platform and will continue to experiment with the user experience across connected devices. We will build everything we do as a genuine open source project, focused on user experience first and build tools to enable the ecosystem to grow.\nFirefox OS proved the flexibility of the Web, scaling from low-end smartphones all the way up to HD TVs. However, we weren’t able to offer the best user experience possible and so we will stop offering Firefox OS smartphones through carrier channels.\nWe’ll share more on our work and new experiments across connected devices soon.”\nFirefox OS was first unveiled in 2013, with the aim of targeting the developing world and late adopters with low-cost handsets.\nTo differentiate from Android and iOS, Mozilla and its carrier partners focused on a web-first platform, with no native and only web apps. Sales, however, were always poor and the devices themselves failed to ignite a lot of consumer interest, and a number of OEMs cornered the market with a flood of cheap handsets. In a business that depends on economies of scale, it was a failure.\nMozilla has been on a streamlining track lately. Last week it announced that it would be looking for alternative homes for its Thunderbird email and chat client. The aim is for the company to focus more on its strongest and core products and reputation. Today the company also unveiled a new ad blocker, playing on its existing approach to privacy and stance on user tracking and cookies.\nMore to come.",
