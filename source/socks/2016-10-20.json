Hit me back when you can.\n\n1. I do have experience with tags. See the attached image below my signature. Is it something like this that you are wanting? I have a contact that can do the sewing. Just let me know the quantities that you are hoping to have made and I can get pricing for you on that asap.\n\n\n2. As for the shirts style, I think that you guys were digging the American Apparel Tri-blend shirts pretty well. Maybe consider those? They don’t have a lot of color options with the tri-blend, so consider the 50\/50 if you want other colors:\n\n<http:\/\/www.americanapparel.net\/wholesaleresources\/ExpressOrder\/catalog\/product.aspx?s=TR406&amp;cid=198&amp;w=0>\n<http:\/\/www.americanapparel.net\/wholesaleresources\/ExpressOrder\/catalog\/product.aspx?s=BB401&amp;cid=198&amp;w=0>\n\nor\n\nI really dig the Canvas Tri-blend shirts and they are at a better price point and have a bunch of colors:\n<https:\/\/www.ssactivewear.com\/p\/bella\/3413>\n\nOr consider a pocket tee?\n<https:\/\/www.ssactivewear.com\/p\/bella\/3021>\n<http:\/\/www.americanapparel.net\/wholesaleresources\/ExpressOrder\/catalog\/product.aspx?s=TR406&amp;cid=198&amp;w=0>\n\n\n3. As for the logo on the inside neck of the shirt, I have indeed done this before. The main issue is that if you pick a super soft triblend shirt, the ink will seep through really easily and you can see it on the outside of the shirt. There’s a few approaches that we can take to remedy this. We could print a transfer which won’t show through. There are a variety of transfer styles that we could use depending on the artwork, so I would just have to check that out and could make a recommendation at that point. Or we could print a logo on the outside back on the neck and that could also look really good. If we print the logo on the inside, I am assuming you’d want to do shirt sizing on the label as well, right?\n\n\nCan you send over the artwork for the tag and for the inside of the neck when you can and we can talk more about what direction to take once I check the art out and once you’ve had a chance to absorb the above info. Let me know if you have any questions…\n\nTalk to you soon.\n\nJustin\n```",
