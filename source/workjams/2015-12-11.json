No matter how many “Vinyl Records Are Back” headlines you see in mainstream news publications, the reality is that thousands of record stores have shut down in the last 10 years all over the World, mainly because everybody started to buy records on the internet.  But luckily, there are still a bunch of great record shops here in Europe where you can spend a few hours digging deep to pick up quality wax. This is not a buzzfeed type of post with “breathtaking record stores you have to shop at before you die”. This is just a guide to help you find good record stores next time you travel to one of the 33 European cities listed in our guide. Most of the stores listed below are record stores specialised in electronic music, but we’ve included a few extra tips for all those crate diggers that want to go beyond the usual suspects. ",
