                "text": "Grandaddy were one of the greatest indie bands of the late '90s and early 2000s. On albums such as The Sophtware Slump and Sumday, Jason Lytle's group perfected a quaint yet expansive version of experimental rock that merged classic rock, scruffy indie, prog, and electronics -- the perfect mix of sounds for cartoonish sci-fi music with a fondness for the great outdoors. They operated in the same sonic sphere as the Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, Radiohead, Sparklehorse and the like, but Scott Weiland loves them too! They are awesome. Listen to how awesome they are. The band reunited in 2012 for a brief reunion tour, but when we spoke to Lytle that year, he was way more interested in quietly pursuing a solo career. He must be ready to reactivate Grandaddy for real, though, because he tweeted yesterday that the band is in the midst of making a new album. Specifically, he mentioned that he's struggling to stop himself from piling on extra layers of sound while tracking a \"new GD album,\"",
