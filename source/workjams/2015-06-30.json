                "text": "Father John Misty has been doing a lot of covers lately, and he recently trotted out another one during a live acoustic session for the Canadian network CBC. Perhaps as a nod to his Canadian hosts, he covered Arcade Fire's \"The Suburbs,\" playing a lovely take of the song entirely solo and acoustic in what looks like an old tool shed. Back when he was still Josh Tillman, Father John Misty grew up in Rockville, Maryland, which is one suburb-ass suburb. It couldn't have been too hard for him to access the song's feelings. Check out the performance below. Father John Misty's excellent album I Love You, Honeybear is out now on Sub Pop.",
