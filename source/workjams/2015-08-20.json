Though Yo La Tengo's influences are disparate, they take a universe of sound and find a way to make those noises coalesce into harmonious balance. Stuff Like That There is the trio's newest album made up mostly of covers, reworkings of old songs, and several new tracks. Structurally, it's a contemporary imitator of 1990's Fakebook. We've already heard their cover of the Cure's \"Friday I'm In Love,\" a remake of I Can Hear The Heart Beating As One's \"Deeper Into Movies,\" and a rendition of Special Pillows' \"Automatic Doom,\" and now you stream the entire album in full below. Stuff Like That There is out 8\/28 via Matador.",
