One of these regular challenges, aptly named “Little Friday,” involves us drawing a team of three Uncorkedologists’ names from a bin and then having that team draw a 3D printed tchotchkes, which becomes their theme, from a golden trash can. From this theme, we have to put on a presentation or event showcasing our interpretation of that theme.",
