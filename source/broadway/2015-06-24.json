I don't know of anything that I can do to immediately improve whistlizer's performance, but I am planning to push these changes since they correctly iterate through all the different configurations in order to get a valid AudioRecord object. If there's a better plan, please let me know! After I make this commit I'll start working on other jira issues in the Uncorked sprint.",
