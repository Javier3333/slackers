        "text": "I think main questions \/ items for me to cover off on today:\n\n1). When do they realistically see this project getting started? (Could we host kickoff next week? How much time do we need for contracts? Do we need a new Service Agreement with this group that's different from our existing one with Google lab?)\n\n2.) We've suggested a phased approach that gets some traction this year but still carries over into next year. (Is that a deal breaker? Can they reach out to the Google Code Rewrite team and refine their 6-week estimates?)\n\n3.) Beyond the initial phase in time for their event, we've also carried a couple iterations to keep the product moving forward. (That's based on our product design philosophy - so that we can continue to iterate on the product. Is that feasible \/ realistic? We should push for this).\n\n4.) Is there any on the ground support or training that's required? (We haven't discussed travel in any capacity).\n\n5.) How soon could they get us demos of the hardware &amp; documentation for code? (What happens if either slips?)\n\n6.) The screensaver currently would require integration with Google Photos. Presumably their influencers would set up an album that we would pull from. For that and other concepts that require integration with Google API's, is there documentation on it? If it doesn't work for us, can we use other publicly available (preferably Google) products and let the Code Rewriter sort out the custom Google API's?\n\n7.) Continuous Integration: Is there a way to get set up with some sort of CI cycle with their Rewrite team to shorten the schedule? Would they be available to discuss an approach early on so that we understand what they're looking for?\n\n8.) Deployment to the Google Store: Evans had some questions regarding this. Let's queue him up for those.",
