Looking through my last saved version of the project on NAS, it looks like I’ve lost a few hours worth of work, so I’m going to head home at lunch to get my machine. After that I believe I just need to work in the flashing alien emojis for the 10 layouts, and clean up any loose ends, then I should be done on the projection portion of the videos. Still waiting for Christian to work on phone videos.",
