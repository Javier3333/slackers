As far as the app goes, I know we have a few different combinations possible. Here are the combinations we're thinking about in order of preference. \n\nPath 1 (preferred):\nballet on wallpaper \ncultural alerts\nPath 2:\nballet on wallpaper\nselfie ball\nPath 3:\ngeo-gazing ball \ncultural alert\nPath 4:\ngeo-gazing ball\nselfie ball \nOur fear is that to do the ballet to the level Jeff will expect, it may be cost prohibitive. But we are looking into options this week. \n\nWe've also hit a wall when it comes to the Google Now team. So we're pushing to find out more about the Cultural Institute database as as stand-alone resource for content. It would be great to get some more details around what you all think we could do as a non-Now, but geo-related, experience to that content. \n\nWe're meeting again with Jeff on Friday and want to come prepared with what is possible to him. \n\nAlso, please let me know if there are any of these combinations that you think are going to be much more expensive than others. I think we we also need to get approvals for the production rough budget this week. \n\nThanks!```",
