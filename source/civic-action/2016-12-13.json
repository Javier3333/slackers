                "text": "Clearly disruption plays out not just in business but also in politics. Whether it was the Scottish national party, recent&nbsp;election campaigns, or local school boards, people grew and organized communities online all last year through NationBuilder &mdash; which provided a software&nbsp;platform for those otherwise underserved from an established technology perspective (hence the&nbsp;disruption theory reference).\nHarnessing the energy of communities goes beyond politics though, to all kinds of movements. But what happens when people remain in filter bubbles on the internet &mdash; the very internet that NationBuilder CEO Jim Gilliam famously called&nbsp;his &ldquo;religion&rdquo;? What happens when that religious fervor or energy can be&hellip; &ldquo;rabid&rdquo;-like? Especially in a context where money, media, and other traditional institutions&nbsp;might not have the same impact or control they once did?\n&ldquo;The internet can reflect back&nbsp;whatever it is that we want it to &mdash; and we need more leaders to&nbsp;step up and say, &lsquo;Look, this is the way that I want it to be&rsquo;,&rdquo; argues Gilliam in this episode of the a16z Podcast in conversation with Ben Horowitz (based on a session&nbsp;recorded at our recent a16z Summit event).&nbsp;Movements, it seems, are really about leadership, and the future is not written yet as people create new models of voice and choice.",
