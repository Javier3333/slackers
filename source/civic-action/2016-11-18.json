                "text": "Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community is a 2000 nonfiction book by Robert D. Putnam. It was developed from his 1995 essay entitled Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital. Putnam surveys the decline of social capital in the United States since 1950. He has described the reduction in all the forms of in-person social intercourse upon which Americans used to found, educate, and enrich the fabric of their social lives. He argues that this undermines the active civil engagement, which a strong democracy requires from its citizens.",

We are moving forward with a platform for online art auctions benefitting ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and others. We have commitments from a number of high profile artists such as Lisa Sanditz and we are working with Gold Collective for visual identity. We would very much like for this to be an ongoing campaign that extends at least through the first 100 days of office. Anyway, if any of this sounds interesting to you and you want to hear more, I’d love to talk your ear off and listen to any thoughts\/feedback\/advice.",
