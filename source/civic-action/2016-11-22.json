The key differences to similar websites are the participation by otherwise commercially unrelated news services in a single platform and the ability for registered users to easily pay a small price per article. It has been called an \"iTunes for news\" in various media.\nThe project was founded by Marten Blankesteijn and Alexander Klöpping. Blendle was backed by a Dutch government fund during its trial phase in April 2014. The service is currently directed at customers in the Netherlands and Germany, but can be accessed elsewhere. The service is planning to expand into the United States in 2016.",
