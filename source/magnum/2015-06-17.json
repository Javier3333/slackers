Five years of unrelenting violence across Syria has claimed close to 200,000 lives. Towns and cities have been laid to waste. Over three million refugees have poured across Syria’s borders into neighbouring countries, desperate for safety. Lebanon has borne the brunt of this forced migration.. Life on Hold takes you inside the world of a diverse group of refugees; revealing their deep sense of loss and fragile hope for the future.",
