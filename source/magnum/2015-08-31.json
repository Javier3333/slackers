When finished, Gaston will roll on to polish\/lower priority items and work through EOD and Joshua will look into hyperlinking in emails. Dev should be complete by end of day today. Magnum is going to update captions tomorrow (Tuesday), so we are currently planning to wait for Emma's word and launch the site Wednesday morning. Let me know if any questions or concerns come up.
