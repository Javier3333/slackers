I have reviewed this issue however at this time as we upgrade and bring our servers back into the standard recommendations for cPanel, we are moving to the recommended jailshell only environment. This results in SSH sessions where once the SSH session ends, all processes spawned are killed. We unfortunately can't change this aspect of Jailshell as it is controlled by cPanel. For services you need to run continually a VPS or Dedicated server will allays be a better solution as there would be no restrictions on CPU usage or process run time that can exist on shared servers. If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact us.\n\nHelp us improve our support by answering a quick survey: \n<http:\/\/survey.hostmonster.com\/s3\/8cf06d21d1bd>\n\nThank you,\n\nMatthew\nLinux Administrator I\n<http:\/\/Hostmonster.com|Hostmonster.com>```",
