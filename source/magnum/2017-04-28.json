        "text": "<!channel> - Just off call with Magnum. Update below: \n\n• First and foremost, they are _extremely thankful_ for what they know has been a complicated firedrill that we're helping them out with. \n\n• I was speaking with Emma, who is one of the high ups there and who is leading the presentation on Monday. She noted that the big meeting on Monday will work totally fine sans new content on site (the material they were working to upload). So while it'd be great to have, I think the pressure for a full site with all new content is off. \n\n• They understand the situation with Hostmonster as a non-viable option (more than likely) moving forward. They agree with our recommendation to migrate to an Amazon instance, but…\n\n• Because nothing can be simple, the people actually paying for the site hosting, AFAC, are based in Lebanon. Emma is going to try to reach out to them today to walk them thru everything, including recommendation that needs to move to Amazon. While she can't say with certainty the outcome, she understands the situation. \n\n• The program itself just got funded for another 3 years of photographers. That's great news, though it underscores the need to not only figure out hosting but also that there need to be updates to sites like this. You can't launch and forget about it. So…\n\n• Emma is also going to advocate that Magnum take over the hosting\/control of the site officially. AND that the fund must include budget for periodic updates, even if they're minimal in nature. Spitballing, I said even a week or two of work every six months with a small team would help ensure not only that shit like this is less frequent, but would also continue improving the site overall. While I said we may be able to help, I caveated that it all depends on scheduling regular time\/effort vs. these sorts of fire drills. \n\nThink that's roughly it. Let me know any questions\/concerns in any of the above. And again, thank you for digging into this. I know we don't have to, and that it's a pain. But thanks.",
