Here’s the link: <https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/sh\/k0cxdl5id0wra34\/AABQxeM8dlIakLwInmKgMwUJa?dl=0>\n\nOr do you mean for the 2016 grantees? I am receiving that content presently and could have it ready for you probably tomorrow. Definitely this week (with press images). \n\n\n*- Do you have any of the videos associated with these projects? Have they been uploaded to Magnum's Vimeo account?*\n\nI do…but am not sure what is what exactly. None have been uploaded to vimeo yet. Can work on this this week. \n\n\n*- Re: Press image. The press image would be the image that would pop up should someone choose to share the website (projects shared in their entirety would use their respective press images). The team had a discussion about this today. Since it's our understanding that Magnum and AFAC do not want to favor one project over the other, is there a logo you'd like to share in lieu of a press photo? Magnum's or AFAC's or another?*\n\nEmma responded and is asking if we can create a jpg that says 'Arab Documentary Photography Project' on it",
