I am very grateful for the time that you and the rest of the Uncorked Team invested in interviewing me. Iâ€™m honored that you considered me a qualified candidate and good fit. It was a pleasure getting to know you and a few member of your team. From our conversation it sounds like everyone I talked to truly enjoys their work at Uncorked and has fulfilling, yet challenging problems to solve. Even as an undergraduate I realize that good work culture is a rare thing and it only after it is only after extensive reflection that I made the choice to accept another offer.\n\nI will certainly keep Uncorked Studios in mind as I consider my steps after graduation. Thank you once again for your time and efforts in considering me as an applicant.\n\nSincerely,\"",
