TLDR\nThe current idea for WLF is too big and too-high potential to constrain to this year's festival time and budget parameters\n\nAccordingly, they'd like to re-use last year's Wayfinding Towers for this year.  There are some hardware\/equipment failures that ZGF knows about that they've requested help with as well as opportunity to iterate on the animation if we'd like this year\n- I'll get more info on that, in a parallel thread with Robert\n\n*We won't be meeting this Wednesday.  The larger group likely won't get together until next year*",
