Any corrections or objections?  I think it helps clarify and plan while we’re async til Wed.\n\nFor our code, we're awaiting next steps from DDD to ensure we can facilitate the handshake.  DDD: when would you like to test?\nFor the podiums (they look awesome - I can't wait to see them live!) we're awaiting the go-ahead to integrate the proximity and touch sensors into the production podiums.  ZGF: when shoudl we plan on doing this?\nWhat's the plan to test the fully built and integrated piece?  \nWhat's involved in set up early next week?  Sounds like ZGF has a grasp on this but if there are needs on others, let's discuss.\nAnd yes, it'd be best to discuss this live.  Wednesday?",
