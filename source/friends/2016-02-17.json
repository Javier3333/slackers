We will be moving their desks into the space this Friday afternoon. *What this means for you:* we will be moving your desks into a consolidated pod of 6 desks closer to the pdx carpet on Friday around lunch time. You can leave you stuff on your desks if you won’t be here and it will not be disturbed. If anyone has questions\/concerns feel free to come talk to me in person or via slack. Thanks guys! :simple_smile:",
