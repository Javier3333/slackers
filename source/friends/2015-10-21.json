Last year, Ecotrust purchased a building on SE Salmon, which they are calling the Redd, the focus will be on supporting last mile food logisitics, connecting the rural harvesters with urban businesses\/consumers.  The event (Redd Mill and Grill) will feature the Coquille Indian Tribe milling cedar logs from their Sek-Wet-Se forest and there will be a salmon bbq, beverages, pumpkin carving, and music to celebrate the Central Eastside Industrial District and the beginning of a new Ecotrust project.  Itâ€™ll also include tours and information about the plans for the property.  4-9 pm, Friday, October 23rd, 2015. 831 SE Salmon Street, Portland, Oregon 97214. <http:\/\/www.ecotrust.org\/event\/mill-and-grill\/|www.ecotrust.org\/event\/mill-and-grill\/>",
