The new network will not have access to Uncorked's internal stuff (but you're currently on Uncorked internal network). Our plan is to have you switch over to the guest network once it is up and running, and then switch the uncorked wifi to an employee-only password. In case you need access to the UNCORKED GUEST network before we officially roll it out, the password will be \"ask why\"",
