        "text": "<@U0289USNA>, <@U02613K0X> here's a thought for the smart quotes button. I don' think I want to put it above the content container, but think it could be nice stuck to the bottom of the text field. As the system grows, i could see this area growing across the bottom for headlines, bold \/ italics, etc. \n\nThe quote icon is in fact already included in the font, and I'm hoping we can also increase the text padding below, so that we don't get any weird overlap. I don't quite remember if this is a toggle or just a button, but in either case we can use the orange+white as a way to show hover or toggle. \n\nWhat do we think?",
