In fact he was with me on my journey into the California lifestyle(15 years ago). patiently he was there purring all the way.

This works amazing on his back legs. Now the snow is here and he seems to be fading. Like me he needs to work out.This simple project has turned into a massive 2 week time sucker. I'm finally done and have learned a lot ...",
