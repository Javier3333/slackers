The deal, which was first reported by The Information and confirmed by our sources, will likely be announced today. The final price tag will top $1 billion we've heard.\n\nGoogle was widely expected to purchase the firm for around $1 billion and that deal was generally thought to be sewn up. That Amazon managed to pull off the snag is notable. We've also heard that Twitch had many suitors, and that the Google deal fell through because Google's offer undervalued the company.",
