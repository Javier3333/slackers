The Blade is one of the nice options for a gaming laptop today. They pack a pretty good amount of power into a reasonably light frame. If you are determined to get a gaming laptop, the Blade is a good choice. However, as the owner of a previous gaming laptop (an Alienware m15x), I will caution you that there are limited upgrades that can be made to a laptop platform. Your gaming laptop will only be pushing top of the line for around 2 years, before things get beyond it's power. I've been a much bigger fan of having a lightweight midrange laptop (a dell XPS12 ultrabook) and a tricked out desktop for gaming. All that said, thinking about how and what you will use it for are always my primary questions anyway, so if portable gaming is your use case, the Blade is a nice option.",
