Top priority is the idea of a pinching measurement tool, in addition to 1:1 photos that can be displayed from the video. The UI would need to handle this content as \"bonus material\" on the side rather than trying to integrate into the video playback and create a complicated system for playback of video + pushed content. First step is that evans will spend some time over the holidays to verify from a technical perspective.",
