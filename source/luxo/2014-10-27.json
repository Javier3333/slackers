Now what we have rough visual id of circles, once we have depth id, we’ll have to determine the method of making it sticky. And then we’ll move right away to gestures. \n\nHardware: \n- Vivitek Qumi Q7 Projector should be delivered today. \n- We’ll have all 3 cameras up and running today. \n- Would like approval on processor today. \n\nHardware Mock-up: \nSince the range at PIT already has a piece of 1020 (1\"x2\") 80\/20 in the hood, we'd like to make our test rig out of 80\/20. That way, once we determine exact placement it will be easy to replicate our setup in San Jose. An added benefit is that it should be easier to modify the rig compared to a wooden structure. \n\nHere's what I need to make an 80\/20 box:\n(4) pieces of 1010-97 <http:\/\/www.grainger.com\/product\/80-20-T-Slotted-Extrusion-2RCP9> ($37\/ea.)\n(1) piece of 1020-97 <http:\/\/www.grainger.com\/search?searchQuery=1020-97($67\/ea)>\n(14) pieces of 3395 anchor fastener <http:\/\/www.grainger.com\/product\/80-20-Anchor-Fastener-2RCU3> ($5\/ea)\n\napproximate cost $285. Grainger has a warehouse in Portland. The fasteners and 1010 extrusion is a stocked item but not the 1020 extrusion.\n\nVisual Fidelity: \n- We put together a test card\/mood board so that we can check patterns and various visual elements. It’s attached, and as soon as the projector arrives, we’ll start taking a look. \n\n\n\nKey UI Decisions: \n- Counter Space - Not recommended. Based on the size of the stove top area, the projector would have to be really high in order to extend to the counter space, and we know it needs to stay at a realistic height. We'll focus the UI on the stovetop.\n- No-Touch Zone - Current thought is that we want to reserve a bar across the front of the stovetop. Dimensions TBD. This is where the stovetop controls would always live.",
