This is w\/o moving video behind the weather faces, I've included ones with moving video in case you wanted to try them.\n\nAlso, I thought of another possible solution to trimming down sprite sheet sizes. It would require you to have a static background image of the watch face pieces that don't move, so the sprite wouldn't have all that repeating imagery in the sprite,  just a lot of transparent spaces around the moving parts. Let me know if you want to pursue this later on for any reason.",

Should we push for leaving that out or should we do what we can to make videos work?\n\nAnd his comment about the rewind of the watch hand not being \"cool\" like it was at first: the only thing that's changed is the frame rate from 30 to 24fps.",
