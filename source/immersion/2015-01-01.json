I've done all the other new gitlab issues as well, except for \"Gesture recognition -- serious issues\" and \"After returning to splash screen, no way to get back in\", because I am not able to reproduce those specific issues. I'm planning to close all of them and make a merge request in the next few minutes, so I'll post to BaseCamp when that's done.",
