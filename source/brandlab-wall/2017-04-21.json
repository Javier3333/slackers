Has another issue, that i think I know what is going on, I am going to look into it a little bit and see if i can give him more info. It has to do with the call for the door close on changing of the preset. It sounds like its failing on them. Im not sure why it would be. Im going to look and see if there is anything obvious \/ remind myself how that worked exactly so i can either fix it or give them a direction to look.",
