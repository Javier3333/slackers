I cant remember exactly what it was. but seems like there was something funky here. The stats were pulled at runtime to get the current values, so that made more api calls to be made at runtime during the setup of the display. It might be worth just getting these stats at the time of saving the workshop in the admin, removing the need to pull at runtime. this would ensure stats are saved for display properly every time.
