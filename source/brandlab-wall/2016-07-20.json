We’re collectively focused on the future rather than mired down with bugs.  It’s a pretty great place to be.  \n\nAs a result it’s taking time to align on the tactical plan for 1.1 but we’re getting close.  I have a proposal out to client for approval and once I hear back, we’ll regroup.  \n\nIn the mean while, we have made solid dev progress on 1.02 items and Peter and Joel are config’ing our rig for conitnued development.",
