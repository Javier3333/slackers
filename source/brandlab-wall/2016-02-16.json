I’m in talks with Josh about potentially pushing out the “in person page turn,” as he’s feeling like March 30 might not be enough time for all parties (IonTank, GC, AVEng) to get their details mapped out and in the TDD. We plan to talk about this on the call tomorrow with the whole team, but wanted to give you all the head’s up now.",
