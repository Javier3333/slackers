                "text": "Resort in tropical area especially in Bali are very numerous in shape and the used of materials, dealing with the international issue about environmentally friendly materials, in such a way, buildings are vast consumers of materials. Some strategies that may be adopted included: reducing materials use and waste associated with construction, choosing material that have low-environmental impact or are salvage and recycled.\n\nSome materials that used in resort dealing with innovative and environmentally friendly materials are:\n 1. Alumunium     \n Aluminium is remarkable for its ability to resist corrosion and light weight. Actually, aluminium is an unusual materials used in resort building, but the innovation of the technology and the long lasting causing new viewing of this materials. The long lasting of this material durability’s has relatively high embodied energy, so the environment impacts of the materials become lower.     Alusion are materials that have variety of range in models, pores, and thickness. Alusion Stabilized Aluminum Foam and its various versions are interior finish panels. They are available in two thicknesses – 1\/2 inch and 1 inch – and in two densities – Small Cell 15% and Large Cell 10%. The higher the density the smaller the cells and the heavier and less delicate the materials. Here are basic kind of allusion that provided in the market :\n Alusion naturalAlusion Open shell-big shell Alusion Translucent   Alusion Resin \nAlusion natural. These materials have a special shiny silver skin featuring a unique waved pattern on to the surface. It also give a new image of aluminium where it usually always seen as a plain surfaces.t also give a new image of \nAlusion open shell-big shell. The shiny silver skin on Alusion Natural is removed through a special blasting process and the cells underneath are exposed. It provides as an excellent acoustic properties because of the best finishing. The density of this version is low (10%) which makes the size of the open cell big. \nAlusion Translucent. It is a very thin allusion within ½ inch on both sides and special low-density material is removed to create translucent panels. This finish is extremely lightweight and allows light to be transmitted through the <http:\/\/material.As|material.As> a result of this, it can produce a nice shadow in wall when the light comes through in.   \nAlusion resin. Alusion Open Cell and Alusion Translucent are coated with a thin layer of resin to create Alusion Resin. This creates a flat, smooth and clear-surfaced finish. The material for the resin finish is created from a combination of acrylic and clear-coated epoxy. The resin coating can be clear or colored to match any Pantone shade. The allusion strengthen is lightweight, relative to size and appearance, however, should not be used in structural applications without consultation with alusion’s engineer. \nThere are some application that related with allusion using:\n    \nApplication from allusion are:\nApartment or resort. Alusion has been used in various forms in the retail sector. It can be used as wall cladding, giving a unique look to the in-store environment. Another major application area is the display fixture. Alusion¹s distinctive look lends itself to endless creative options.\nFurniture. Alusion can be used for creating innovative and unique furniture items. Various versions of Alusion are 100% recyclable and can be employed in creating totally recyclable furnishing items.\nSignage. Alusion can be used for outdoor signage for retail stores, hotels, buildings, etc. With the application of a marine-based powder, AlusionTM is readily adaptable to exterior use. It should be noted that allusion is non-combustible and suitable for use at temperatures where other aluminium components would be used, rather than that it is 100% recyclable and is produced using post-industrial aluminium, which is composed of 20% post-consumer aluminium. \nPrices: A one-time fee of $250 for colour matching applies. A scratch-resistant coating can be applied for certain applications, as desired.\nReferences : <http:\/\/www.alusion.com\/applications.html>  \n2. Lumicor \nLumicor is done by lamination, it constructed within uniting two or more layers of materials together and in between is filled within real fabrics, such as leaves, forest fern, beach grasses, or natural papers to any environment. Lumicor can be fabricated using conventional power and hand tools. Many Lumicor products may be formed into unique shapes for dramatic design possibilities. The industries best suited to work with Lumicor are plastic and solid surface fabricators.\n\n\n          \nShortly, these materials perfect for creating a nature inspired by surrounding because it made from the real fabrics, and without spend much time taking care of the original plants. Environmentally friendly materials can achieve in using ecologically harvested from sustainable crops. Hand placement of reeds makes each panel distinct.\nThese product offer a choice of 3 high performance resins to suit a variety of applications with their own advantage:\na.       Lumiform. Lower Flammability, Superior Impact Resistance, Thermoforms at Lower, Temperature, &amp; More flexible.\nb.      Lumiclear. Outstanding Clarity, Excellent UV Absorption, Renewable Surface, More Rigid \nc.       Lumiguard. All of the Benefits of Lumiclear™ with Added Chemical Resistance Ideal for Horizontal Applications or Areas Requiring Stain Protection  \nApplication:Lumicor used as a panel and also decoration element for interior spaces, such as lobby, spa, office or any location, to create nature atmosphere, within the original colour and texture. The differences of the thickness depend on the using in the room, as decorating elements the form can be re-mode as suitable as the spaces.  \nPrice : $45.00 per square foot, each panel being on average of 32 square feet\nReferences : <http:\/\/www.lumicor.com\/> \n\n\n 3. Nature Surfaces\nNature surface is product by marrying traditional skills with modern technical expertise and precision. These products are made of natural materials from Asia and South America by highly talented artisans and craftsmen. There are vast range of patterns, colours, and finishes, and it is applied on several kinds of substrate and they are equally suitable for both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional applications.  These products finished by hand polishing, for example Mother of pearl which is a traditional decorative material in Vietnam, the pieces is hand cut from pearl oyster shells. It usually use as architectural applications within surfaces in panels of standard size and configuration and furniture &amp; accessories for merchandising in 3-dimensional.The product treated with Polyurethane and the default substrate for our surfaces is MDF. Stain\/chemical resistance, we use fast set spray grade polyurethane which has good chemical resistance to most commonly-used chemicals. Actually, Polyurethane chemistry can be essential to the continuous progress made in environmental stewardship and efficient use of our natural resource, it also make higher durability of materials. \n\n\n\nMother of pearl collection: silver brick mop\n\n\n\nThe smooth surfaces can be renewed or refinished as long as usage or damage has not breached the polyurethane top coat. Relief and natural finishes cannot be renewed.\n\n\n\n\nMother of pearl collection: silver brick mop\n\n\n\n\n    Mother of pearl\n\nPrices :  The prices for our products range from € 425 to € 700 per square meter, for prime and select panels on MDF. Our prices relate to volumes in excess of 10 square metres. For volumes less than 10 square metres, an extra charge of 10% will apply. Volume discounts apply for orders in excess of 50 square metres.\nPanel dimensions  : may be specified, including oversize dimensions, defined as more than 122 cm x 244 cm. We can make 3-D forms and shapes and can advise on suitable techniques and materials. 3-D forms can be made to any required size and shape. All our surfaces are or may be finished with Polyurethane. For most materials, this allows a choice of sheen: matt, semi-gloss and high-gloss. For many of our materials, there is also a choice between a smooth surface or a natural\/relief texture. In the latter, the raw material is only lightly sealed. References : <http:\/\/www.naturesquared.com\/applications.htm>\n\n\n\n\n 4.    Coconut Tree.       \nMaterials that still related in Tropical area and many of them still protected are coconuts tree. Tropical area is blessed with large area of coconut plantation, which require regular replanting. This has created large supply coconut wood that can be used for various purposes.       Coconut tree has many range of use, all of coconuts body can used as a building materials, furniture, and decorating elements. Coconut wood can be used as a beam of gazebo or building and also wood flooring, the leaves used as thatch roof, coconut fruit used as decorating elements. Although many kind of wood that is available in local market, such as teak, bangkirai, rattan, bamboo, and so on, coconut wood is the widest material insists in the market, because it is a biodegradable product that protects the environment.   \nOne of the new innovation of coconut is for flooring materials, here are some references for the flooring one side is a local product and the other side is an international product.\n\n   Coconut flooring\n\nFlooring made from coconut wood is marked for its unique dark grain and as hard as regular hardwood at noticeably lower price. On the left side is a local product n the other side is international product whereas the price also quite different, on the right side the prices ranges from $ 49 to $499. Many innovation developed in coconut, from the simplest used as beam until it manufactured as a flooring materials. The coconut has not just developed in Indonesia but most of tropical country has this plant, so it make easier for the renewable and the recycle this materials. \nReferences : <http:\/\/www.alibaba.com\/catalog\/11462763\/Coconut> flooring.html<http:\/\/www.gotoreviews.com\/archives\/2004\/09>\n\n\n\n\n\n ",
