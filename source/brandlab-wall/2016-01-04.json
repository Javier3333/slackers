What are our options in terms of travel speed inches\/sec for the linear actuators? \n1b. What does speed control for the linear actuators look like? PWM from a micro? Or is there some sort of prepackaged controller?\n2. Seems like it would be helpful to retrofit curved arms on the hinges in option B to help clearance. Can you evaluate viability and cost\/difficulty?\n3. Accessing the full width of the cubby seems to be much more important than the full height. For all options, does moving hinges\/actuators to the top of the cubby help preserve full width? When open the screen can cover the top half of the cubby. Or how do we avoid using an inner sleeve? \n4. Is the hinged opening mechanism for option B mechanized?\n\nThanks again",
