If there’s anything you’re working on that you want to discuss, ping me and we’ll catch up this morning.  \n\nIn the mean time, Google shared with us their INT Case Study Video for Cubby Wall.  Check it out but NOTE: THIS IS CONFIDENTIAL AND CANNOT BE SHARED OUTSIDE OF THIS PROJECT TEAM\/OFFICE.  \n<https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2gf-t3rGWqY>\n\nSome notes I took away:\nOfficially referred to as ’the Cubby Wall’\nGoogle INT Storypoints:\n- Bookends for the Workshop day\n- “Delivery of curated insights addressing brand and their marketing challenge. “\n- “Personalized and interactive welcome - customized insights right as they enter. “ \n- The screen ‘robotically’ opens.  \n- “Outside really clean and elegant.  Inside is quite complicated. “\n- “Meaningful story, really google-y technology”\n\nNice shot of Joel (bring the beard back!)",
