But since these are all remote and not on the machine running IS it will not open it on them, and there isnt a mechanism to do so. Before when it was running on the other server there was an app that handled that and the touch events. Now they need something to replace that and showtime helps fill that gap since that actually should work failrly well here for this, albeit its a bit of a mess right now. But hopefully that is just a first step towards conversion to showtime and off IS",
