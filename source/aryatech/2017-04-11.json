It relies on the 3.5mm jacks on the local computer for microphone and speaker interface, so we’d need to ensure that the Chromebox (if that’s what you settle on) has those connectors. Since its so stripped-down, it may not.\n \n<https:\/\/www.revolabs.com\/products\/conference-phones\/wireless-conference-phones\/voip-bluetooth>\n \nLet me know what you think. I may be able to get a sample unit from my rep if you’d like to test it out.\n \nThanks,\n \nJosh Seitz\nOhm Systems, LLC\nAudio| Video | Data | Surveillance\n124 SE 11th Ave Suite B, Portland, OR 97214 \nPhone: <tel:(503)484-5700|(503) 484-5700> | Mobile: <tel:503-841-7251|503-841-7251> | Fax: <tel:(503)258-0382|(503) 258-0382>\n<mailto:josh@ohmsys.com|josh@ohmsys.com>",
