Experiment with different weights between conference rooms and secondary rooms\n\nGoal is to show Matt your progress so we can determine which option will go up for paper prototyping. *Your job is to make sure an approved version is taped up on all of the rooms by Monday 5\/1. Avery and Charles will be on site at 811 all day Friday, so please coordinate and make this happen.*",
