One thing I want to make sure stays in our minds as we move further into execution - there is desire for the new room numbering system to stay in play and be shown somewhere on the rooms. Not sure if or how we're currently planning for that. They don't have to be front and center (think VIN number on a car - small and findable) but we don't want those numbers to fade away and never be used again. LMK if you have thoughts\/questions\/concerns.",
