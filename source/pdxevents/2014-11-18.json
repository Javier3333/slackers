These devices shatter another consensual hallucination that we web developers have bought into: mobile = touch and desktop = keyboard and mouse. We have tablets with keyboards; laptops that become tablets; laptops with touch screens; phones with physical keyboards; and even phones that become desktop computers. Not to mention new forms of input like cameras, voice control and sensors. One of the core things that responsive design has taught us is that we have to be comfortable with the ambiguity of not knowing what the size of our canvas is going to be. Input has that same ambiguity. It is transient. It is unknowable. Reconciling that understanding from a design and implementation perspective is going to be as big a challenge if not bigger than the one we faced coming to grips with responsive design. We&#39;ve learned how to respond to screen size. Our next challenge is learning how to adapt to different forms of input. <h3>Our Presenter, Jason Grigsby<\/h3> In 2000, Jason got his first mobile phone. He became obsessed with how the world could be a better place if everyone had access to the world&#39;s information in their pockets. But <abbr title=&#34;Wireless Application Protocol&#34;>WAP<\/abbr> was crap so he headed back to the desktop web for several years. Now Jason spends far too much time thinking about mobile. Jason is a mobile strategist, co-founder of <a href=&#34;http:\/\/cloudfour.com&#34;>Cloudfour<\/a> and frequently speaks about mobile technology and strategy. Follow <a href=&#34;https:\/\/twitter.com\/grigs&#34;>Jason on Twitter<\/a>. Join us after the event for a short walk to The Raven &amp; Rose for food &amp; libation. <h3>Our Venue, eBay<\/h3> eBay&#39;s Portland office is located at <a href=&#34;https:\/\/goo.gl\/maps\/lMTvr&#34;>1400 SW 5th Ave<\/a>, in the Community Lounge on the 3rd floor. Please arrive prior to 6:30.",
