I get that those are all things that members can purchase. It seems like, in terms of category, the products here are Care Premium, CareExpress and Concierge. The other services can be acquired individually or within the context of the product packages. Is that right? Can we reflect this?\n*Before Slide 10* consider signaling this as a new section \"Content and Merchandising.\" It just has a different feel than high-level functionality slide (8) and\/or the dashboard high-level view (9).\n*Slide 20* is a little bit anomalous. The \"content\" could be clarified so that it's as solid as the content on the other slides. Also, is \"third party integration\" a product? I'm not sure it's mentioned as such anywhere else.\n*Slide 22* looks like the beginning of another section. Consider inserting another section title slide for \"top level navigation.\" Also, that section parses out the \"functionality\" (slide 4). Can you somehow bring these things together? Maybe explain during the preso (at slide 4) that they should expect a deeper dive of the functionality toward the end of the talk? Or maybe start with an entire functionality section (I know we've talked about this and there's a good reason not to do it. How can we honor that insight AND cement  the relationship between slide 4 and slide 22- 26)? \n\nlooks super great, you guys!",

Couple of thoughts and questions:\n\n1. <@U4VTSDW7P> The sections on slide 2 aren't feeling like they quite match up to the content in the deck past the Context section. And while I think we'll iterate past this gateway, I'm a little nervous about putting that in writing right upfront. Lastly, since the monetization opportunities are going to be contained in another deck, I'm wondering if we nix that from this table of contents and just match these to our big red slides. Thoughts?\n\n2. I started a doc for the agenda - I'm hoping folks can think through how long these sections will take to get through and assign themselves sections so we know who is driving what tomorrow. (Last time we went over an hour so want to make sure we set aside the right amount of time for the deck then prototype). <@U0HP6TFNX> <@U0GN0A9EV> \n\n3. Are we at the point where we can delete the slides past Thank You? I'll need to send off the deck at 9am tomorrow so hoping it's ready for me to PDF by then.",
