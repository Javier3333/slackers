I was reading some writings by Dr. Brene Brown over the weekend and started thinking about how a lot of the core interaction on <http:\/\/Care.com|Care.com> is (I think unfairly) surrounded by guilt. Guilt that you can’t be there to take care of your parents as they took care of you, guilt that you would are prioritizing x over being at home with your kids. I know this is very similar to what you already positioned so nothing new to see here, but as you re-conceptualize care, I encourage you to look into Dr. Brene Browns writings <http:\/\/brenebrown.com\/brenes-favorites\/books\/wholehearted-reading\/>",
