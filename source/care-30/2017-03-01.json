We are also reshaping what the expectations of the 13th meet and greet with Sheila(care founder) and Allison (west founder) will be. We are thinking about moving away from additional work\/paid sprint, but rather continuing conversation, giving you more info and posing a few questions to your team to come prepared to discuss. \n\n&gt;Feels like a paid proposal at this phase, without a deep discovery won't be super valuable, so we would rather prepare for a super quality conversation. Send you more tomorrow and again thanks for the call!",
