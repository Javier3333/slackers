        "text": "Dont read this until tomorrow - but lets discuss the validity of the following assist strategy (briefed james and evans, but want collective confirmation):\n \nDear Val, We hear you and understand the situation and commitment that has been name - hence why you are looking only for a bid that allows bot on prod for June. However, if that is the case, I am afraid we are probably not the right partner. We would love to work on getting a bot like this to market, but overall our concerns are: (1) we feel it is a bit too risky with the tight timeline and having no access\/experience with Care’s live envt, (2) its not how we approach work, straight to prod without the full strategy consideration… With that said and wanting to get you *something* - and also loving to look at this second project as a way to get more familiar with the Care stack to in turn make our 3.0 tech assessment more on-point - here is our bid for approaching it: (1) non-prod, but high fidelity and stack *considered* and (2) with upfront strategy and a set of core usecases and considered voice exercise. \n\nFurther thinking:\nDESIGN\/STRAT\n+ Begin engagement with a kickoff of 2 weeks of determining the bots “reason for being” - what value does it add in the current live product - where\/why\/how for whom\n+ Then starting to consider the bot’s “voice” as a extension of care’s brand, authority trusted source, and consumer equity builder (2 more weeks)\n+ Simultaneously to voice definition, begin considering the UX and current visual skin of the bot experience integration (same 2 weeks as ^)\n+ Finish out the rest of the 8-10 weeks with strat\/copy working on scenarios, voice, etc (though only a few will make it into proto, this will provide a more fleshed landscape for the potential of the on-prod build)\nTECH\n+ As described (though alot of grey still without stack knowledge and without full scope of scenarios) we would see this on-prod external in about 6 months-ish; beginning with 2-3 months off-prod, while simultaenously investigating envt and producing migration spec\n+ Migration spec would likely include tech definition, multi-platform prototypes (assumed using twilio, a web interface, and some modified version of iOS\/android), and an API definition for care to implement against internally \n+ Two lines of work here: \n(1) is likely more allocation of the PP-TD to further investigate the complexity of the care system, (beyond 3.0 research, to consider more thoughtfully the manner in which the bot would integrate) - working towards definition for the migration spec\n(2) is a platform specialist who will research the assumed manifestations listed ^^ and advising the design team through their collect phase - then adding supporting resources to start in week 3-4 (through remaining 8-10 weeks) on building out all the decided prototypes on UCS envt, documenting along the way for later migration team\n\nFor Charles\/Abby: i see this as a smaller creative project - collect\/concept the reason for being with 50% strat, 50% UX, and 50% copywriter (2-3weeks max), transitioning to 10% strat, 10% UX and 100% copywriter (whole rest of the project), from a tech standpoint, we have someone looking at the complexity of the care system at 10% over the length of the project (prob 3.0 PP-TD) and then a supporting tech lead starting at 50% in first 2 weeks to investigate bot platforms and advise on strat, then moving to 2x100% (1 mobile, 1 web) while the copywriter goes off to do their thing, through end of project… 50% producer, minimal executive oversight, minimal HofP hours (its the same PP meeting)",
