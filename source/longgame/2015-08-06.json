I don’t think we’re going to convert people into Long Game this way, and honestly, I fear we could poison the well by showing people a boring game without the benefit of the savings.\n\nUltimately - the audience for this is an audience that wants to save money. The game play isn’t anything other than a way to win some bonus money, and if you’re in it solely for the winnings there are way way better places to do that. \n\nThe most compelling offering LG has to offer is that moment when you’re playing AND saving money at the same time.",

Yes, we can offer cashless games in all states, but I have a hard time seeing someone being compelled to do that. Especially considering that LG holds your money for at least 2 years.\n\nWorse is that not making this clear up front saves the incoming disappointment until the person has already gone through the signup process, which for my money makes LG feel a little skeezy. \n\nEven if we do end up offering a cashless playing account - I feel strongly that we should make that clear at the beginning of the relationship instead of once they’ve finished the signup process.",
