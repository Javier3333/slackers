Justin and I are excited to walk you and Ashby through it!\n\nBefore we meet, I wanted to touch on the update you shared with us last week around Long Game finding a way to operate in every state. First, wow! That's exciting. Justin expressed already, but we all believe in Long Game's mission and think it has the potential to affect a lot of positive change.\n\nIn discussing this update we realized some implications. For example, the backend architecture was not drafted to operate differently on a state by state basis. It should be flexible enough for it, but without knowing the solve for each state it's impossible for us to know exactly how that might impact the tech end of things. \n\nThe same can be said for design since it sounds like some states may need different games. As you can imagine, this presents a unique challenge in scoping a second phase of the project. \n\nIn the spirit of aligning expectations for tomorrow's meeting I wanted to give you the heads up that we will present a product roadmap with second phase that would conclude in launching with a single usage scenario. \n\nHope our reasoning here makes sense. Happy to hear any questions you may have tomorrow if not. \n\nAlso, does the room we're meeting in have a phone? I'd like to dial in Marce, David, and Jenny. Let me know when you have a moment!\n\nThanks!\n\nAmanda",
