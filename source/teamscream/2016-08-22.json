Don’t worry about writing style, but please do use the above questions as headers (so I don’t misinterpret what question your answer is pertaining to).

We aim to understand UCS' employees' level of awareness of this subject matter, educate where appropriate and to outline a series of policies and procedures that make staffers advocates for inclusive, safe and productive work environment.\n\nBy applying our experience with research, semiotics, system design and technical builds, we can develop a program, roll out plan and specs for building particular tools.\n\nOur target audience: lots of us are likely to have a friend, family member, colleague etc suffering from some form of mental illness.  We're interested in what resources are available to those that are affected but may not necessarily be afflicted themselves.\n\nHomework: 10 questions to help us understand our office make up.  Impact of stress and emotionality.\n\nFirst steps tomorrow:\n\n-  Compile our 10 questions.  Work with Ivan to craft a survery and rollout plan\n- Continue collecting ideas around: Awareness, Ways to influence Policy and Tools we can create.  We'll hone in on these as we better understand our office makeup.\n\nCaptain's log of Monday accomplishments:",
