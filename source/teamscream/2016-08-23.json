There's no polish on this re-cap.\n\n*We had a breakthrough today*: when we chose our problem statement, we largely chose a topic.  An area of focus.  Since then we've been riding the wave that is this labs-process and circling around how to stay true to ourselves, our topic of choice and our users.  Today was spent focusing almost exclusively on users.  At the end of today we found our breakthrough - the overlap between our users' needs and our topic: stress.  Stress management.  Impact of workplace on an individual's stress and conversely, individual's stress impact\/contributions to workplace environment.\n\nStress.\n\n*This lead us to a decision point:* where to place primary emphasis:\n\n- Target the organization.  How to help the organization be aware of and deal with an individual's stress.\n- Target the individual.  Equip he\/she to be more aware of their stress; socialize the concept of stress and equip him\/her with a means to combat\/deal with stress.\n\nIt's important to us that we align on a target audience but don't neglect the secondary audience.  It's all a connected system.\n\n*And further, this lead us to an understanding of next steps:*\n\n- Break apart for the morning (but still work in Glass from 10:00-lunch)\n\n- <@U0H4SJN11> : focus on environment\n- <@U0J6TE0CA> : focus on what we can do to equip individuals (a survival kit?)\n- Dennis: how to impact policy\n\n- <@U0GN0A9EV> : can you get us time to talk to John about plans for 'Living Lab' space in Arya?\n\n*Quick snapshot of accomplishments today:*\n\n- Homework: everyone came with great questions and a focal point for our survey\n- Debated the delivery vehicle of survey vs. interview.  Aligned on interview and interview tactics\n- Completed an interview outline that was focused, successive and a good blend of open-ended questions and multiple choice so we could pull patterns from this qualitative data.\n- Interviewed 5 people!\n- Synthesized the findings\n- Took a break\n- Reflected on findings\n- Experienced a break through\n- Aligned on clear path of action for tomorrow\n\nWow, that's a lot.  I left tonight feeling happy with the process, proud of our accomplishments and humbled by the learnings from working closely together in new ways.  Thank you.",
