Today we accelerated.\n\nBy splitting up we were able to collectively invest the morning into:\n\n- Impacting policy\/culture Dennis\n- Researching an environment's impact on emotional well being Miguel\n- Researching and ideating about the kinds of tools we can give people Emily\n\nAnd taking time to talk to:\n\n- David Ewald about plans and utilization for Arya office space\n- James about doctor match making\n- John about how to learn from each other's preference an make decsions about physical space\n- Ivan about the plans for new employee onboarding toolkits\n\nWe learned three big things and experienced our second breakthrough:\n\n- We're constantly coming back to our users and I can confidently say we are not straying from their needs\n- We have found a life after labs for each one of our favorite ideas.  By leveraging other group's learnings, events etc we can piggyback or bolt on in ways that allow us to lead the kinds of change we wish to see around here.  This is big time, humbling yet exciting stuff.\n- We are able to cover the most ground by splitting up and pursuing components of a connected program.  We've got big ambitions, good focus and a healthy line of communication that allows us to remain aligned.\n\nWe've got two days left.  Here's what we propose to achieve in these two days:\n<@U0J6TE0CA>  will build a 'emotional well being toolkit.  She's got our blessing on the ideas, form factor and organizing principle.  We agree on the paramaters of keeping it purpose-oriented but playful and if possible, cheap enough to garner easy approvals to activate for new hires moving forward.\n\n- At next check point: present to us the final list of things that will go in to the survival kit.  Associated rationale and cost.\n\n<@U0H4SJN11>  is tasked with helping our environment be more inclusive and create safer spaces for a dialog. He will build plans for a 'hut'-like structure that allows 1-2 people to have meetings.  A name for the structure and a proposal for how to utilize this, observe users and prove it's ROI.\n\n- At next check point: present to us the structure of the experiment\n\nDennis will work on how to strucutre\/roll out the followng kinds of policies:\n- Removing stigma from idea of 'mental health day.'  Make it actionable to Ops team if they are interested.\n- Develop a program and some potential candidates for a MH 'Matchmaker’\n- Draft some rules of engagement around how to use our various communications tools so that they don't add unnecessary or undue stress to our coworkers\nAt next check point: be ready to drop something and scale to help either Emily or Miguel\n\nWe'll remain nimble so we can pivot to bolster action.  If it becomes clear one or more of us can join something to help realize it, we'll do it.\n\nWay to go ya'll.  Let's finish strong.",
