Review the Test Plan (with special emphasis on the prototypes we need and that we may need Google help to carry out some of the testing 3.)

And testing if devices are unregistered, semi registered, or fully registered is a big factor in making this device feel integrated and magical from the very beginning of the brandlab. I’m not sure that the device will have as much impact if a facilitator just hands me a phone and tells me what to do with it. It’s the guest’s first impression of this companion piece and we want it to be a magical, fan-fucking-tastic one!",
