        "text": "_Talking about 'cameras' taking 'photos', though, is a pretty narrow way to think about this - rather like calling those internet-connected pocket supercomputers 'phones'. Yes, the sensor can capture something that looks like the prints you got with a 35mm camera, or that looks like the footage a video camera could take. And, yes, it's easier to show those images to your friends on the internet than by post, and easier to edit or crop them, or adjust the colours, so it's a better camera. But what else? Terms like camera or photo, like phone, are inherently limiting - they specify one particular use for underlying technology that can do many things. Using a smartphone camera just to take and send photos is a little like using Word for memos that you used to create on a typewriter - you're using a new tool to fit into old forms. Pretty soon you work out that new forms are possible. _",
