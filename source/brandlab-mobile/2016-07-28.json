Tell him we’re open to a name change, but we were trying to anthropomorphize the system to embody the “mentor” role in a Hero with a Thousand Faces (i.e. _The Hero Meets a Mentor to gain confidence, insight, advice, training, or magical gifts to overcome the\ninitial fears and face the threshold of the adventure.\nA Hero may not wish to rush into a Special World blindly and, therefore, seeks the experience and wisdom\nof someone who has been there before. This Mentor has survived to provide the essential lessons and\ntraining needed to better face the Journey’s Tests and Ordeals. The Mentor may be a physical person, or\nan object such as a map, a logbook, or hieroglyphics._)",
