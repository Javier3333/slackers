My read on his email (and again, I feel at a detriment in that i wasn’t in the conversation earlier to have full context) is that he’s saying what we’re suggesting as a test for BL guests is right what we should be doing. Perhaps that’s what you mean by fine in near future Justin. \n\nBut I also see that Patrick is trying to sort of out guess the future a bit. What are complex, post-initial launch materials that MIGHT be part of this thing? If we’re making the effort to invest in it, how will it continue to evolve? That’s my read on it anyway. \n\nAssuming I’m even in the ballpark of what he’s saying (not a given), I’d like to try to parse the two needs apart a bit — What we know we intend to test now, and as part of how we move forward we could begin to brainstorm future iterations of what it might be (lightly). I’m pretty strongly of the mind that we don’t know what we don’t know (testing phase 1!) and that the product future will shape itself based on what we find out (iteration!). \n\nSo my read is less that Gidge is on a different conceptual page as much as he’s caught between two sets of voices — one saying let’s focus on the testing we’ve all outlined, the other (Patrick) saying let’s defensively think of this thing to out guess everything.",

While I (or any one else) can’t obviously know what sorts of things the might someday do, the fact is that we very intentionally reduced the scope of the app so that it would not distract from the in-person, hands-on nature of each workshop.
