Once the console finally made it into reviewers’ hands, it was discovered that the Nintendo Switch’s Joy-Con controllers also worked with PCs and smartphones as a standard Bluetooth gamepad. That’s wonderful and not at all unexpected for a controller that communicates via Bluetooth. But starting today, it can also be used with the equally tiny NES Classic Edition using 8Bitdo’s wireless retro receiver adapter.",
