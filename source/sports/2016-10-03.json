Especially in the long, long, term. It’s pretty clear by now that Helf and crew can’t develop anything other than slot receivers, but it feels like the program is okay with that because it fits better with Nike. I just don’t see a world where Phil Knight is super stoked on bringing in a defensive guy, or really anybody with a new identity.",
