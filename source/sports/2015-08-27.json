                "text": "Steelers receiver Martavis Bryant is facing a potential four-game suspension.\nBryant is currently appealing a suspension under the league’s substance-abuse policy, Adam Schefter of ESPN reports.\nThe Steelers selected Bryant with a fourth-round pick in the 2014 NFL draft. As a rookie, Bryant didn’t play at all in the first six games but showed great promise down the stretch, catching 26 passes for 549 yards (a whopping 21.1 yards a catch), with eight touchdowns. This year the Steelers were expected to get Bryant even more involved in their passing game.\nInstead, the Steelers may have to plan for a month without Bryant’s services. With Le’Veon Bell also suspended and Maurkice Pouncey injured, the Steelers will be starting the season at much less than full strength on offense.",
