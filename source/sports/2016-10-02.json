I would have thought Cal was a winnable game, but that’s starting to look questionable and that they too might be able to beat the ducks – so is there not a win on the ducks schedule until the civil war?  Perhaps the buy week before Cal can right the ship.  Most coug fans are saying we needed our bye to fix ourselves before being able to come out and beat the ducks, so fingers crossed for you guys, I  want the north to dominate, so now that WSU beat the ducks, I’ll pull for the ducks from here on out.",
