                "text": "Gilbert Arenas measured up as a rival to LeBron about as well as Ricky Davis did as a sidekick. This is unfair to a player as good as Gil who, had he not self-medicated a torn-up knee with packing tape and a staple gun, would probably be out here killing, since he was a shorter, stronger Jamal Crawford with like 20 percent Dwyane mixed in, and Jamal will play until he’s 50, but this is what happens when you voice over your on-court highlights by (allegedly) shitting in sneakers and pulling a gun on your teammates. (The Gil-Javaris locker room standoff is one of the more perplexing sports moments of my lifetime, in that everyone just kind of got over it. Imagine this happening today—Russ pulling a gun on Reggie Jackson last year for fucking up the dap line or some shit. We’d be on that for YEARS. That’s as certain of evidence as the universe can offer that no one will ever give a shit about Washington sports.) Anyway, given the rep, when Gil throws up an incendiary LeBron James take on Instagram, you might reflexively just laugh him off and send him back to the carnival. But give it a closer read and it’s a capsule of exactly the reason he stuck around the league despite being a crazy person.",
