Even last year, losing to teams like the Browns, Tampa Bay, and the Jets—we'll get to that—they still managed to top their division with 11 wins. Much to the dismay of everyone outside of Yinzerdelphia, the Steelers are a pretty solid franchise.\n<https:\/\/sports.vice.com\/en_us\/highlight\/nfl-dos-and-donts-pittsburgh-steelers>",
