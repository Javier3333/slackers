        "text": "<!channel> Bike update: I chatted with Leonard from Beam today and sent him our list of suggestions. He said that he can't promise anything (they did just install those basement racks, so updating them would be a pretty big undertaking ... sounds like the top and bottom bolts on the racks are relatively tamper-proof (someone would need some serious power tools to remove them). He said that retrofitting the existing racks with cables to accommodate standard u-locks would probably be the easiest thing to do, but i stressed that a security camera would be ideal. A cage seems a little further off. Adding a bike stairway for that little stairways might not even be worth it since the length of those stairs is about the length of a bike anyway. I don't think we'll win that one.",
