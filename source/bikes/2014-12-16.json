Traversed, seen, and photographed by millions, #pdxcarpet proves to be the most popular and well-designed carpet of all the airport carpeting ever. Commemorate it by wearing it on your bicycle during all of your travels. This helmet is hand-painted with acrylics and individually vinyl printed in our studio. It's also coated with a UV-protected varnish, making its surface scratch and water-resistant. Each helmet comes with adjustable foam padding for the perfect fit. The S\/M fits head circumferences 20\" - 22.75\" and the L\/XL fits head circumferences 23\" - 24.75\". As all the helmets are made to order, this item will ship in 2-3 weeks.",
