The Bike Commute Challenge is now the Bike More Challenge, and it's happening the entire month of May (National Bike Month!) instead of September to keep you pedaling all summer long.\n\nNew website! The Challenge is going to be bigger and better this year and that means the website will be too! Heads up that on April 1, <http:\/\/bikecommutechallenge.com|bikecommutechallenge.com> will be deactivated and you will no longer be able to access your previous trip data. Click here for instructions on how to download your personal and team data. Please note that you will continue to have access to previous years' results here.\n\nEvery ride counts! We changed the name because we're opening trip logging to ALL types of bike trips. Participants will now be able to log their bike rides to work, the store, or just for fun. Whatevs!\n\nWe've got apps! You can easily log your trips with the Bike More Challenge native app (Love to Ride) or with an activity tracking app you may already be using such as Strava, MapMyRide, or Moves.\n\nEarn badges! You get badges for being awesome. The more you bike, the more badges you will unlock to decorate your profile and show off how much you #bikemore!",
