We've dug back in to the RFP scope and have some thoughts on how we could work together to bring this to life.\n\nFrom our end, we took a look at what would be needed to build this out, and try and get something closer to the $200k budget you proposed. A rough timeline would be as follows:\n\nWeeks 1-3 - initial design, BLE connectivity interfacing\nWeeks 4-6 - control panel implementation\nWeeks 7-10 - if\/then programming interface implementation \nWeeks 11-14 - QA, testing, refinement\nWeek 15 - Launch submission\n\nTo bring scope more in line with budget expectations, we would propose the following caveats:\n\n- Platforms would be limited to iOS, iPhone only.\n- As such, windows and android applications are not considered in the budget. We'd expect users to upload sketches via the Arduino IDE or for the hardware to come preloaded.\n- For the If\/Then language, we'd want to look at simplifying this to one-level deep for UI, UX, and technical complexity. \n\nThe total cost for this would be $290,000. We understand that's still above your budget range, but want to be transparent about the effort we believe an undertaking such as this would require. Below is a breakdown of our staffing allocations, as a percentage of overall timeline. These would ebb and flow as work needs, but generally represents the allocations we would apply.\n\nDesign Director \t10%\nDesigner \t\t22.5%\nProducer \t\t20%\nCTO \t\t\t2.5%\niOS Developer #1 \t40%\nQA \t\t\t5%\n\nThank you again for your consideration for PAM â€“ it's an exciting project that we would love to help bring to life. Let us know if you have any questions.\n\nThanks,\nCharles\n```",
