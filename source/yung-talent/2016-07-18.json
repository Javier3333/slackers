At standup today we were able to check Slack integration off off the to-do list, saw a dope LED prototype, and thanks to some work from Jack Cleveland we established that the cost of a lot of the necessary materials (e.g. RGB LEDs, wood panelling) is going to be minimal.\nThat said, it's partly my fault that I didn't realize how dope the team was and I done put the cart before the horse a little bit in terms of client wants\/needs. The meeting I scheduled tomorrow is for us to get out some fleshed out prototypes of possible designs for the client to review - since the software side has gone so smoothly thus far it seemed prudent to put all of our energy into the A\/V design for the rest of this sprint, otherwise I think a lot of us are going to be twiddling our thumbs. Hope to see you guys there!",
