(3) These aren’t the things I would have studied. (4) This isn’t an answer that’s compelling to me.

Are we missing some, and are any we’re considering nonstarters for you?” Later the designers return one more time to say, “We plan to do these analyses on the possibilities that we’ve agreed are worth exploring; to what extent are they analyses that you would want done, and are we missing any?”_",
