Jack Malsin is away today and Monday on a rafting trip -- I'm gonna schedule a meeting for Tuesday to vote on which project we'd like to move forward with. By then:\n1) we'll hopefully have some client feedback about which of the options presented they're interested in.\n2) JackM is back from his rafting trip and ready to vote.\n\nIn the meantime between time give some thought to which project you'd actually _like_ to work on in advance of the vote and be ready to vote for your top pick(s) on Tuesday!",
