We're liking two of the concepts, and have a few questions\/concerns on both -\n\nWiFi Viz - Cool idea, but we're a little concerned about how it's going to come into fruition. Would have been nice to see more of the executional plan and details.\n\nMood Ring 2.0 - This is probably our top contender, but it's got to scale and be able to continuously scale pretty easy. Actually that continuously scaling idea is one we're excited about.\n\nI've forwarded the proposal on to our stakeholder James and will follow up when we hear her weigh in. Hope you have a great weekend.\n```",

I hope to come out of that with a game plan we can run with, at least for the next couple of weeks. Everything from materials we'll need to how we're going to organize the team. It'd be great to dig into actually making our product as soon as we can!",
