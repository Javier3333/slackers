I changed the UI a little bit to accommodate more buttons, added some additional information for photo\/video stats, updated how we are gathering phone call stats so that it actually works as expected, and fixed a few other small bugs. I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to work with Google Hangouts as the default SMS app, but I haven’t found anything promising yet. I will keep you posted!",
