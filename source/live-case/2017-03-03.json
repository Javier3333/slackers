[It would be great to get some more caseIds for this to test with different user Lat\/Lngs, I’ve been using the one on NfcChip]\n3) Select one of the existing styles and colorways. Try lots of different combos. Make sure to select the user’s case style as well.\n    - Note, also try the path of setting ‘Match my location’ to false so it is using your physical case before you go to step 4\n4) Install the places-Update.apk over your other one. Do not uninstall the places-buildOne.apk build, it should be able to upgrade with the new version number.\n5) Return to Live Case, you should be shown the dialog that there are new cases once, and if you hit ‘ok’ it will not show it again. \n6) The physical case should be the leftmost, with all the new styles to the right of it. If you had selected a style &amp; color that was not your physical case, it should be the rightmost icon and should be persisted even if you select a different style.\n7) Test and use the other features to make sure nothing was accidentally stepped on and broken in the process, or for any other feedback on this. Thanks!!",

If I toggle the DZ setting off and on again, it works as expected.\nOliver is looking into it now",

I have one more fix I think that I'll be able to get in there (that weirdness we were seeing <@U1ZG1UCAK>  for when the physical case style was the same as the selected style but with different colors). And the clean install issue <@U2H61EJSG>\nWe talked about that dynamic zoom issue in siberia, but to get it here, I tracked the zoom changes, it looks like it is from when the app is killed and restarted from the install, the DetectedActivity has a lag until it has the previous value, this appears to be how the app will currently function whenever there is an update, not stemming from this update",
