        "text": "good news. I think I got a fix for what appears to be the image rotation issue, at least it works on the images we were able to repro from midori’s gallery and should work for any image that is relying on its exif tags for orientation.\n\nHere’s the run, we weren’t able to repro with that existing image because of what midori suspected, that slack is cleaning up the image tags when we re-download it from here, which is why we were having trouble repro-ing on the original pic.\nThe reason the image is displaying alright when in the Moments preview display and on the Crop Activity is that we use Glide there and pass the file and so Glide is able to properly orient the image.\nIn the BitmapRegionLoader right now, that code handles getting an orientation in degrees passed to it, but all of the calling methods to it call the default method (which always passes in 0 for rotation). \n\nAnywho, the fix is fortunately a low-risk patch because the BitmapRegionLoader is already built to handle this, and also fortunately, the fix comes in when reading the file (so it doesn’t matter for these existing users if the data is already loaded into one of the LiveCase databases. <@U13GPDA1F> would you want me to cut a build + branch with this?",

                "text": "Some digital cameras are saving the snapshots as they come from the digital sensor. This is not always the right orientation, as it depends on how you are position the camera. Luckily, the cameras are also saving the orientation information into EXIF attributes.\nThis article is about how to automatically correct this from your Java program, using jMagick. The entire thing can be break down into pieces: read an EXIF attribute for an image, interpret the value and transform the image.\nThe EXIF attribute responsible for orientation is called Orientation. According to EXIF specs, the values have the following meaning:\n1 = The 0th row is at the visual top of the image, and the 0th column is the visual left-hand side.\n2 = The 0th row is at the visual top of the image, and the 0th column is the visual right-hand side.\n3 = The 0th row is at the visual bottom of the image, and the 0th column is the visual right-hand side.\n4 = The 0th row is at the visual bottom of the image, and the 0th column is the visual left-hand side.\n5 = The 0th row is the visual left-hand side of the image, and the 0th column is the visual top.\n6 = The 0th row is the visual right-hand side of the image, and the 0th column is the visual top.\n7 = The 0th row is the visual right-hand side of the image, and the 0th column is the visual bottom.\n8 = The 0th row is the visual left-hand side of the image, and the 0th column is the visual bottom.\nOther = reserved\nGraphically, this looks like this: .\nThe following transformations should be applied to the images according to their EXIF orientation:Autorotate EXIF images\nwhere the possible operations are horizontal or vertical flip and rotate (90 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise and 180 degrees). The corresponding jMagick methods from MagickImage class are:\nhorizontal flip &ndash; flip()\nvertical flip &ndash; flop()\nrotate 180 degrees &ndash; rotate(180)\nrotate 90 degrees clockwise &ndash; rotate(90)\nrotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise &ndash; rotate(-90)\nNow let&rsquo;s translate everything into Java code:\n\nprivate static final int NONE = 0;\nprivate static final int HORIZONTAL = 1;\nprivate static final int VERTICAL = 2;\nprivate static final int[][] OPERATIONS = new int[][] {\n        new int[] {  0, NONE},\n        new int[] {  0, HORIZONTAL},\n        new int[] {180, NONE},\n        new int[] {  0, VERTICAL},\n        new int[] { 90, HORIZONTAL},\n        new int[] { 90, NONE},\n        new int[] {-90, HORIZONTAL},\n        new int[] {-90, NONE},\n        };\n\npublic static MagickImage rotateByExif(MagickImage image) throws MagickException {\n    try {\n        int index = Integer.parseInt(image.getImageAttribute(\"EXIF:Orientation\")) - 1;\n        int degrees = OPERATIONS[index][0];\n        if (degrees != 0)\n            image = image.rotateImage(degrees);\n        switch (OPERATIONS[index][1]) {\n            case HORIZONTAL:\n                image = image.flopImage();\n                break;\n            case VERTICAL:\n                image = image.flipImage();\n        }\n    }\n    catch (NumberFormatException exc) {}\n    catch (NullPointerException exc) {}\n    return image;\n}\n\nNow you can simply call the rotateByExif method. For more information on how you can use jMagick to load and save images please see the official documentation or see Watermark with jMagick article. Actually you can even integrate this, so that you apply it to the watermarked images.\nSo actually it is pretty simple to rotate images according to the EXIF info using jMagick: just get the EXIF Orientation attribute with getImageAttribute() method and, according to its value, apply the rotateImage, flipImage and flopImage.\n\t\t\n\t\t\t44.438553\n\t\t\t26.090635",
