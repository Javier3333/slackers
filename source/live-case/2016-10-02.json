Turns out that the TOS link has to be loaded based on user physical location and not system locale. I'm looking into options on the Android side for this (geocoding the country from the user location) but was wondering if that's overkill? If we had an interstitial page that did the geo and redirect, would that be smarter? ( <@U13GPDA1F> )",
