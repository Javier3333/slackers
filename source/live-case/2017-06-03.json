They've been shared with Bonnie, but I'm sure I'll need to go over them with her at some point early next week. I'll let you know when I hear back! :slightly_smiling_face: \n\nIn the meantime, are you able to pick up some other tasks in JIRA (since I think you're now blocked from progressing on this until we're able to get some clarity?",
