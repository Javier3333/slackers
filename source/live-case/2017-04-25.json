This would probably be the quicker half-way point\nIf if they want a more continuous mapping, we could play around with non-linear functions that would make it feel more continuous but would be a higher level of difficulty in terms of getting the response right\nI agree with Melissa and Evans, slider isn’t the best control here. I think it warrants a reminder of how many users are actually using this feature in favor of minimizing dev time as well.  I think also points to using a switch, which is the quicker implementation",

And (to confirm with call with Bonnie) there isn’t a spike of other runtime exceptions (ie didn’t read image correct, then goes to retry the next one and hits a OOM or something because we are in a bad state). It seems that in the vast majority of times it fails once and then successfully sets the next image.\nFrom people’s reports where this seems to happen repeatedly to the same user, so I’m wondering if something is happening along path where the case Earth image is set. \n\nThat number, ~20,000 still seems high for me given how infrequently we have been able to reproduce, along with our daily getImages could being on the order of 3-5,000 users. Something is causing this to get triggered multiple times.\nHopefully after this call with Bonnie, I’ll have more info to test out some hypotheses",
