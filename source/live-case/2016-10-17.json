Potential for network errors (but we can work around)\n- Locale-specific scheduling still TBD (considering nice-to-have for November, but will reassess once we've dived deeper)\n- Push history not saved to app (a la Editions) as post content less suited for (can discuss further if this is a goal)\n\n*Need to define*\n- What content fields need to accommodate (assuming title, linked image, body copy)\n- How to handle locale-specific scheduling \n\n*Next steps (Uncorked)*\n- Implement the ability to associate each registered wallpaper with ID based on case (prior to minime public release) - in progress",
