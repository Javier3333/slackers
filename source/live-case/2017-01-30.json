Here is the latest Gauge build. The data now represents the current 24 hour period: there will be 24 peaks and 24 valleys - peaks representing time spent with the screen on and valleys representing screen off duration (i.e. There will be 1 peak and then 1 valley for each hour). The data points are determined by calculating the percentage of on\/off usage over the given hour. For example, if my device’s screen is on for 60 minutes, the peak will be 100% and the valley will be 0%. The colors still change, but they now reflect the device usage over the last hour so that users can detect a change more frequently. Let me know if anything else needs clarification!",
