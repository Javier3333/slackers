                "text": "Halloween is over, so we can officially talk about all the presents we want this holiday season! A gift that has always been popular is the Easy-Bake Oven, which is one of the coolest presents ever and a great way to get young ones interested in the joy of cooking.\nBaking isn’t an especially big pastime in Japan since very few households have a proper oven, but this product from Mega House is the perfect way to get kids interested and involved with cooking. It probably won’t be just kids clamoring for this kitchen aid either; adults are certainly going to want this as well because it teaches us a skill every grownup gourmand will appreciate: how to make homemade ramen noodles!\n\nOfficially called the O-Uchi de Ramenya (“Ramen Restaurant in your Home”), this Easy-Make Ramen toy is perfect for those who don’t feel too confident in their kitchen skills. For many of us, the thought of making our own ramen is daunting, but with this kit everything from the assembly to literally cranking out the noodles is really simple!\n▼ The noodle cutter, tray and main part\n\n▼ It’s just so beautiful!\nThe kit comes with three types of cutters to give your homemade noodles various sizes of thickness. There is also a way to turn your very straight noodles into curly noodles. Additionally, if you’re craving some wonton or gyoza to go with your ramen, you can make the skins for those as well.\n▼ A multitask-er! Oh, the choices!\n\nFor those who are worried about special ingredients that might be required by this “machine”, you don’t have to fret; it’s already stuff you should have in your kitchen. A video from Mega House details the exact ingredients and provides a step-by-step guide to making delicious ramen noodles.\n▼ Hard flour\/bread flour (300 grams), soft flour\/pastry flour (100 grams), water (about 190 grams), salt (8 grams), eggs (2). Using all-purpose flour (400 grams) would definitely work as well.\n\n▼Combine the water, eggs and salt, then add the flour and baking soda\n\nIf we had one of these O-Uchi de Ramenya, we could end our diet of endless Cup Noodles, and instead feast on our own homemade creations! You can buy one of these handy toys online from Amazon for $49.25 to enjoy in your own home with your family. Though this may be marketed as a kids’ toy, we think it’s a product that’ll really get adults excited too.\n▼ This is one of those things you buy for the kids and end up using yourself\n\nHappy noodling!\nImages: Mega Toy, YouTube\/MegaHouseJP, ",
