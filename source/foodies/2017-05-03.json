My home garden is all planned out for the summer, so we have (hopefully) most of our needs being met. I'm unsure what to do with this windfall of land. \n\nDo I make things easy on myself by planting a bunch of the same food (ie peppers or melons) so that when I visit upkeep is relatively easy, and I can plan to harvest and replant in pretty narrow timeframes, or do I keep the same sort of variety I have at home and just lump the fact that the upkeep will be a little more intense?",
