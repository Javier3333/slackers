And he’s never talked s— to my face,” Fieri continues.\nRELATED: Anthony Bourdain: ‘Ina Garten Is One of the Few People on Food Network Who Can Actually Cook’\n“It’s not that I’m not open to the reality that the food world was like this from a few people’s perspective. It’s just, What are you doing? What is your instigation? You have nothing else to f—ing worry about than if I have bleached hair or not? I mean, f—.”\n\nStill, we suspect that Bourdain won’t be letting up any time soon.\n“I tell jokes about Guy Fieri,” the Kitchen Confidential author told PEOPLE in September. “The day you can’t tell jokes about Guy Fieri, comedy as we know it is dead. I tell jokes about those guys; it’s what I do.”\nRELATED: You Have to See Chrissy Teigen Dressed up as Guy Fieri for Halloween\nIn the summer, Bourdain got himself into hot water when he said that Ina Garten was “one of the few people on Food Network who can actually cook” — and slammed Fieri for “being 52 years old and still rolling around in the flame outfit.”\nAlton Brown, a prolific cookbook author and Food Network host, also took issue with Bourdain’s sense of superiority.\n“When was the last time you saw Anthony Bourdain actually cook anything?” he said. “I’ve spent 14 years cooking my own food on television and I’ve never seen him cook a meal.”\n—Maria Yagoda, @mariayagoda\nadFactory.getCmAd(600, 100, \"ideasarticle\", \"tout\").write();",
