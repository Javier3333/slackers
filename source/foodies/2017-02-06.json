                "text": "Sous vide Kickstarter darling Anova announced over the weekend that Swedish appliance giant Electrolux has agreed to purchase the cooking hardware startup for $250 million.\nThe Anova brand will remain intact under the deal, retaining its name and the leadership of co-founder and CEO Stephan Svajian, existing&nbsp;as a part of the larger Electrolux umbrella.\n&ldquo;With Electrolux, we&rsquo;ll have the resources and reach to continue to change the way people cook,&rdquo; Svajian writes in the post. &ldquo;Electrolux is committed to helping Anova continue its mission of building the Anova Kitchen&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;a kitchen where devices are precise, dead-simple to use, affordable, and connected in a meaningful way to help people cook like pros every day.&rdquo;\n\nSvajian told TechCrunch on a call today that the move cements Electrolux&rsquo;s interest in the connected kitchen as part of the smart home hub.&nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a very strong value set between the two companies,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re super impressed by their commitment to keep us autonomous and invest in this new strategic direction.&rdquo;\nThe company&rsquo;s history dates back to 2013, launching a Kickstarter campaign the following year, and raising $1.8 million in the process. Anova has kept plenty busy since then. Last year it released a second generation of its cooker, this time with Bluetooth\/WiFi functionality and this past CES the company announced plans to release a lower cost version.\nSvajian told TechCrunch that the company is sticking to its plans, but added, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not allowed to comment on future products at this point.&rdquo;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;",
