And let’s not forget the Tupac Shakur-themed plastic shoe. Today’s shoe is no exception: Might I tempt you fine people with Croc Martens? What’s that you say? Did I hear just a resounding “NO!”? I have to agree. From what I can tell this boot isn’t a real thing, but a pretty good photoshop job meant to upset us. It worked. Even though this isn’t real, how much do you want to bet that it will be someday? Why? Because humans can’t help themselves. via The Kraftfuttermischwerk",
