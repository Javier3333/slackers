It&rsquo;s as if two extraterrestrials who vaguely understand how humans communicate might try to replicate interactions in a stage play.\n\nSpeaking of stage plays, though the two Homes have each given multiple different names to each other, they are tagged &ldquo;Vladimir&rdquo; and &ldquo;Estragon,&rdquo; a reference to the two chatty characters in the classic Samuel Beckett play Waiting for Godot.\n\n\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, nearly 650,000 people have viewed this conversation.",
