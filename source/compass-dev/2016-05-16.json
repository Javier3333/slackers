I’ll be posting my findings from that later in the week, but something else came out of that meeting, mainly that they wanted to offer themselves up as a resource for any and all UX related questions we might have.\n\nI know that you all are probably already aware that they are here for you, but I wanted to re-emphasize since they seemed adamant about this point. They offered to set up a recurring meeting where we can ask them questions but since we’ve been so good about keeping meetings to a minimum (thus far) it seems like a good idea to let any needed meetings be ad-hoc.\n\nPlease do feel free to reach out to them with any questions you  might have and schedule meetings as needed. Because our slack integration with their team won’t preserve historical data, how do folks feel about moving back to using the Compass Questions trello board for tracking these questions?",
