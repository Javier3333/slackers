Both need to do work on the cubby - here’s the plan:\n- Touch calibration still leaves something to be desired.  <@U0EL0GLEL> to try a software adjust this AM and report out\n- If more work is needed, we’ll look at the cable connection when the box is pulled from the wall\n- Speaking o box being pulled from the wall, it needs ot be because <@U02E3CRMA> needs to investigate why the lights no work.  \n\n<@U0EL0GLEL> do yout thing and let us know how it goes.  When you’re done, Joel and maybe <@U0H4SJN11> or <@U02F8LF2X> can move the cubby",

We might want to take a swing at getting that cable in there better when its pulled out anyways just for good measure",
