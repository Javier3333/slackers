I am going to work on a few bug fixes there, some reason image upload broke when i went live. I am also working on opening up this editor to the top sweep also. right now being locked to just cubby since its based on my prototype from earlier. And top sweep is a little more complicated since its huge and doesnt fit nicely on the screen. but they can start sending things to the cubby right now to work against those touch screen imperfections. Also working on finishing the touch forwarder after we can get that last screen zoomed in with the correct planar config. early tests show it works just need to dial it in for the zoom. since its calibrated to the full 4k due to the way it works etc... easy software fix just need the working screen to do that calibration on",
