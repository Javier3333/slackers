Ideally we chip away at the below tasks locally and depeneidng upon progress, we can decide whether we hold these and include in dot release or if we can roll em out and test them Tuesday evening\/Wednesday before we leave.  List is as follows:\n\n\t•\tNew loading order\n\t⁃\tRight now the drop down list populates to the right place in the order however, the graphic needs to be updated to reflect this otherwise it is confusing\n\t•\tAPI\/Admin: Check to ensure colors matching is sufficient\n\t•\tAdmin: when re-visiting a previously built workshop, James needs to refresh every time he comes back to the workshop.  Without refresh he won’t see the Brand Name populated so cubby assignments don’t show up.  \n\t•\tData Viz accuracy:\n\t⁃\tRight now I have to hardcode the questions in a auricular order (reference what we have in KFC - in this order it works).  When you switch around the order of these questions, sometimes the answers go to the wrong questions on TopSweep.  TL;DR a deeper look at the logic is required here.  \n\t⁃\tYesterday we had ten cubbies in use.  I answered for each cubby (no Skips).  One of the questions only logged 9 answers.  One logged 6.  One logged 11.   TL;DR a deeper look at the logic is required here.  \n\t•\tYT Trends pink triangle appears to have a jog because I think there are two assets here.  larger triangle is laid atop of a smaller triangle\n\t•\tIn order to get the YT watermark off of our YT Tends videos, can you look into a ‘modest browsing’ setting?  James gave us this tip.  \n\t•\tCubby question animation: dots should always come in before text \n\t•\tAdmin: Graceful fallback in the event a brand doesn’t have a YT channel",
