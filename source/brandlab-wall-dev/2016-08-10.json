So requesting a bodymovin animation with a color that doesnt exist errors and returns nothing, then the transition system would try and play that bodymovin and fail. result whitescreen. Only happened when the api didnt pass a color for the user, and then it was still a random draw so only a few of the users ever possibly got this no color. Most of the time the color from the api was there and we were fine. Explains why it took a while to see and happened once. 32 - user error, this is not how the admin works, the checkbox for asking questions has nothing to do with travel distance 33 - this could happen if the cubby was running the sequence and they reset the preset while it was still waiting for the other transitions to occur, like it was on the auto advancing slides and they reset it. In the flurry of the 5 mins before launch i could see that happening.",
