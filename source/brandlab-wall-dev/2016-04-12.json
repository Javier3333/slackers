        "text": "So here is the info on how the display worked, a custom nvidia resolution setting of 3840x2160 set for the planar displays. so they are putting out 4k. The chrome window is dragged over both displays. then i used a program to kill the windows title bar. Going to either make our own program to do that since i have the source for the program that did that, or use this other one that embeds chrome into a windows form and allows the same thing. The ptz had to be reset after I set the new resolution, looks like it must base its calculations on the current resolution when its set. After resetting the ptz the screen looked perfect. Nice that the solution was actually not complicated. so recreating is pretty easy. When we get the top screens installed there is some really great bezel correction options in the nvidia software that we can use to correct for them.",
