You will need to use this to complete the tutorial seen here:\n\n<https:\/\/developers.google.com\/showtime\/>\n\n<https:\/\/drive.google.com\/open?id=0B7_hrEXCXPvEUFBmV29YZjUxekU>\n\nThere is one file that will need to be altered per user - the 2nd line in the \"agent.json\" file says something like \n\n  \"siteId\": \"UNCORKED-john\",\n\nYou will need to replace \"john\" with your first name, all lower case.\n\nAccess should be granted based on the email addresses that were supplied in the meeting invite.  \n\nAdditionally I have created a SITE for each one of you.  For example, for John, that site can be seen here:\n\n<https:\/\/showtime-qa.appspot.com\/#\/showtime\/UNCORKED-john\/>\n\nAgain replace \"john\" with your first name as listed in your email address and that will be your site.\n\nDon't worry if the terminology is not yet clear, that is all covered in the documentation.  \n\nPlease let me know if you do not have access yet to any of these resources, and please feel free to email me if any of the documentation is unclear.\n\nThanks,\nMike",
