And I need to hit on a list of functions, just reading that the mouse did something is cool but i need to know which, and stop the OS from seeing it until I redirect that input. the redirection im not concerned about, that part is pretty easy usually. Swear ive done it before with this tech. I think we will be good for monday. nice thing is my laptop im working on has a touch screen and what ive been able to tell is it works the same as the others. the response is different than a standard mouse but the same as the other touch panels",
