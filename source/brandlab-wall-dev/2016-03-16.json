IE the template used for cubby and BFD and the questions asked, consumer barometer data, youtube videos whatever is sent through, we would need to have that all set on this one UI. Since that is how the preset admin system works from IS, you build out a data object for that preset and send it along. We would need to follow suit and do that also.
