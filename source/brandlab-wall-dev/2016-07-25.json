Which makes more sense now. We had never seen it since our test set had 1 color, and the next set had 2 and they were mostly the same. So wouldnt have manifested in a way that we would notice. Its shows up when the workshop has been sent to the wall, its displaying, then the admin says oh shit move another person to some spot, the move will happen but the body movin animation for that first animation was already loaded with the previous color, the file doesnt appear to be rerequested in the new color. but the other data does so the color of the circle doesnt  match the links. and when you move past that first screen the others are in the right color. Can recreate by opening the display, push the workshop, then change the assignment of the one you are looking at. to someone with a different color assignment. you will see the original color circle persist. I looked at the network logs and could see that it never requested it again. Which makes sense when i think about it. Would need to add something to refresh that",
