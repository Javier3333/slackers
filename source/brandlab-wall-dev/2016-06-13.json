There's also a fixjsstyle that comes with it, but when I tried it out, it doesn't appear to fix everything.  I also found this Eclipse Profile for JavaScript.  Hopefully that will work for you.  If that doesn't work, there are really 3 settings that will address most of the warnings I've seen:\nConvert Tabs to Spaces\n2 space indent\n4 space continuation indent.\nLet me know how it goes.",
