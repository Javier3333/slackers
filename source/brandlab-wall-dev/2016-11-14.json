The massive over simplifying they would want to do with how the admin worked from a simply data input form that is run off a schema is pretty far from what ours does. We have lots of prefetch going on around the youtube videos, validation of the data from there so that it doesnt have to be done on the display side. As well as extra meta data stored for the questions asked around how to word them on the top sweep and cubby etc… As well i dont see anything about how they simply validate a fields input. And If I am following along it would store a more strict list of data, im not clear if we can save more data to info stored for the show or not as it is. I stored quite a bit of extra data and pre processing of the data input. What im saying is if it was iframed, would we be able to store all the data we needed, or would it be simply looking for a field of data to come back. I think we will need to inform them around this as we progress. Would like to see things do the reusability and such that they are aiming for. but expose the route for the custom data for these cases where utter flex is needed",
