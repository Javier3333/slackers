She was followed closely by her father, Calum Neff, 31, of Houston, who set a pending stroller half marathon Guinness world record of 1:11:27. Neff shattered the existing record of 1:13:50, run by Travis Boyd at the 2013 Heroes Half Marathon, by more than two minutes, with an average pace of 5:27 per mile. He won the race by nearly six minutes, and he used a GoPro to broadcast his run live on Periscope.",
