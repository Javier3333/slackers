Meet Kuvée, a refillable case that keeps wine fresh for up to 30 days.\nAnnouncing $6 million in funding from General Catalyst, Founder Collective and others, Kuvée aims to impress your dinner guests with a built-in touchscreen that tells you the history of the wine and also suggests food pairings. Get serving tips, receive personalized wine recommendations, and reorder directly from the device.\nWith patented technology that prevents open bottles from spoiling, CEO Vijay Manwani tells TechCrunch that Kuvée could make it easier to drink “wine by the glass any day of the week,” since the unfinished beverage will stay crisp through the weekend.\n\n\tRelated Articles\n\n\t\t\t\t\tVinebox Offers Wine By The Glass As A Monthly Subscription\n\t\t\t\t\tMachine Learning Used To Predict Fine Wine Price Moves\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon&amp;#039;s \"Prime Now\" Expands To Seattle Region, Adds Beer, Wine &amp; Liquor Delivery Option\n\t\nThe Kuvée system is compatible with select California wines, including Bonny Doon and Pine Ridge.
