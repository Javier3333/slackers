By check-in with #snackball, the automatic ball launcher is actiavated and throws a ball in the park. The dog has to fetch the ball as fast as possible and then bring it back to their master. If the dog was fast enough, fresh and healthy Snack is automatically released from a dispenser.\n\nBy appling the new Beacon technology in the SnackBall. We first installed an Rasberry Pi to read signals from the Snackball and track the speed and distance. By tracking the time needed and synchronizing it with the dog’s size, we can find out how fit the dog is. And if the dog is fast enough, it is rewarded with GranataPet. If not – the SnackBallMachine might be the perfect work out for lazy dogs. Over. And over again. \n\nWe started a new move in the dog scene for more healthy dogs. Possibly even the owners, too.",
