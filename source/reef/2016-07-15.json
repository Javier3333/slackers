It was mirrored from the original exported file because a hermit crab needs a right-handed shell spiral due to the way its abdomen curves.Pimp out your hermit crab!This is the prototype shell for Project Shellter, the current artist residency at MakerBot <http:\/\/Industries.It|Industries.It> is modeled on the shell of the Cittarium pica sea snail, <http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cittarium_pica>, and is similar to the ones that crabs in pet stores typically <http:\/\/sport.It|sport.It> was created using Sage, <http:\/\/sagemath.org>, exported to an STL using a modified version of Christopher Olah's plugin, <http:\/\/trac.sagemath.org\/sage_trac\/ticket\/7744>, and thickened in 3DS Max.You can explore other shell shapes here <http:\/\/sagenb.org\/home\/pub\/2928> (account required).The goal is a workflow using open source tools, but the conversion of the surface to a solid at this point requires a commercial tool.Maybe someone can figure out a way to thicken the surface without 3DS Maxâ€½Follow Project Shellter progress here:<http:\/\/projectshellter.comhttp:\/\/twitter.com\/ProjectShellterhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/ProjectShellterhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/ProjectShellterCamshttp:\/\/bit.ly\/ProjectShellterVideos>",
