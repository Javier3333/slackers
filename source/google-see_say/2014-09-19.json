I'm handling touch events through the Activity (which controls the view heirarchy for the capture screen and the voice note recording screen), so all I need to do is find out if the user is touching the screen in a certain place and do the right thing... the solution was to simplify rather than re-engineer it. But it could definitely use more testing.",
