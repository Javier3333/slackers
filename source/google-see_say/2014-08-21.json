OCR is a cool idea and I want to go farther with it, but it's a lengthy and error-prone tech, and the people who are going to be demo'ing the app need to see something cool happen in 5 seconds. I hope we can do a Google search on the image, though, I think it would be cool for the buying and knowledge search cases. But any cases that assume magical image analysis will have to be hardcoded demos.",

I think doing some basic analysis (like color-matching the image and using a corresponding hard-coded case) can stand for the concept of instantly and magically analyzing the image and converting it to useful content. Given infinite time and money, we could build that feature, but in the time we have now, we can show how it would work in some specific cases, and I think people will enjoy it",
