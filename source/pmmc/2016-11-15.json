                "text": "Three-phase electric power is a common method of alternating-current electric power generation, transmission, and distribution. It is a type of polyphase system and is the most common method used by electrical grids worldwide to transfer power. It is also used to power large motors and other heavy loads.\nA three-phase system is usually more economical than an equivalent single-phase at the same line to ground voltage because it uses less conductor material to transmit electrical power. The three-phase system was independently invented by Galileo Ferraris, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky, Jonas Wenström and Nikola Tesla in the late 1880s.",

                "text": "Join us the weekend of Dec. 2nd-4th for our very first IoT Hackathon! The theme is Sustainable Cities; we are looking for ways to minimize the required inputs of energy, water and food. On a smaller scale, how can we preserve energy and prevent wasteful consumption in the home and\/or at work? We are thrilled to be partnering up with Intel to bring you the Intel Edison hardware kits to play with and build cool apps. Other sponsors for the event include Simple, Airbnb, Mozilla, Metal Toad, Donut.js, and PolySync.The goal of the hackathon is to learn new programming skills, have fun, and work in teams to build sustainability solutions. We want to provide a space for people of all backgrounds to learn about IoT, work on a new portfolio project, or spend all weekend tinkering with hardware. All levels are welcome! You will be working in teams of 3-5 to come up with the next great solution for Sustainable Cities!PREPPING FOR THE HACKATHON- Webinar: Monday, Nov. 21 at 7pm - led by Intel - Workshop: Saturday, Dec. 3rd, 9:30-11:00 AM - led by Intel - Pluralsight has an online course: Node.js and the Internet of Things Using Intel Edison (you can sign up for a 30-day free trial) HARDWARE- Intel Edison Compute Module- Intel IoT Developer Kit- Grove Starter KitTIMELINEFriday, December 2nd5:30 - Doors Open + Dinner6:30 - Official Welcome + IoT Lightning Talks8:30 - Pitch Ideas + Team Forming10:00 - Go Home and RestSaturday, December 3rd9:00 - Doors Open + Coffee + Bagels9:30 - Workshop on Intel Edison - Led by Grace Metri, Intel IoT Evangelist11:00 - Hack12:30 - Lunch7:00 - Dinner10:00 - Go Home and RestSunday, December 4th9:00 - Doors Open + Coffee + Bagels12:00 - Lunch1:00 - Submissions Due + Presentations Begin2:30 - Winners Announced 3:00 - Closing RemarksRULES- All coding for the Submission must be done on site at the Hackathon. - By coming to this event, you are agreeing to follow our Code of Conduct CODE OF CONDUCTWomen Who Code (WWCode) is dedicated to providing an empowering experience for everyone who participates in or supports our community, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or socioeconomic status.
