Let’s regroup at 2pm today to look at some ideas for how to use the space and equipment\/facilities within.  \n\nTo mentally prep think about:\n1.  How we could use the space we saw the other day\n- <@U0HPGQ4KH>  has some ideas.  We’re playing in the realm of _scenarios_ for the space.  Not fully figured out and literal - yet - but something that can spark stakeholder imagination.\n- I’d like to ask <@U02E3CRMA> to stay close to Felix and I in figuring out what this space should and shouldn’t accomplish\n\n2.  The kinds of services and facilities that the space should include\/offer\n- <@U0K8ZSHN0>  I’d like to see what kind of progress you can make on list today before you head out\n- How <@U02F8LF2X>  can pick this up next week\n- And how <@U02E3CRMA>  and Felix can stay close to it so that we shape the offering\n\nhit me with questions in the mean time.",

I thought Felix did a great job giving us something to have a conversation around and we’re building on the momentum of good questions and ideas.  \n\nI’m connecting with <@U026NB2U2>  [to mostly ensure that I’m not steering us off the rails, haha]  Will post proper meeting notes once I’ve connected with him.  \n\nBased on what we discussed I think the following action items and next steps move us forward significantly:\n- what if we wanted to build the first 100-1000 units of Sommely?   Well what does that mean exactly?  Not everyone understands all of the pieces? <@U02E3CRMA>  is diagramming out\nfrom there, we can look at what we can do in the space, what an offering pkg might be, market app etc.  *but it all starts with understanding.* \n- <@U0HPGQ4KH>  mock up of the bldg exterior transformed into the home of PMMC.  A photo real version and an illustrated version for reaction\/testing.\n- <@U0HPGQ4KH>  ideas for how to paper prototype model that allows us to block out the space and configure it a number of ways based on equipment\/service needs.  \n\nI’m hoping to regroup Tuesday.  Will touch base on Monday to see how everyone is feeling.  Happy weekend in the mean time",
