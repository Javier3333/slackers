As soon as I finish typing the word, my Grammarly spell checker promptly underscores it in red and suggests a replacement: “micro-manufacturing.” But this new spelling is about to go mainstream. When I say micromanufacturing, I don’t mean making tiny (micro-scale) components. There’s another definition at work here: “Micromanufacturing is the manufacturing of products in small quantities using small manufacturing facilities.” I'm talking about “tiny factories.”",
