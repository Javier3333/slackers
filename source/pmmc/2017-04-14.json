                "text": "In many parts of the world, living in a trailer has gained a social stigma. We&rsquo;re talking about a rectangular building placed on three wheels and towed to your preferred plot of land. It&rsquo;s going to take a lot to break that social stigma, but this is a pretty sweet attempt.\nPassivDom is an off-grid home. It sidesteps the electrical grid as well as water and sewer service. It&rsquo;s marketed as utilizing revolutionary breakthrough in wall insulation which they claim makes it very easy to heat and cool. In addition to this self-sustaining angle, it taps into the tiny home movement with a footprint of just 36 m2 (4 m by 9 m; about 118 ft2 or 13&prime; by 30&prime;).\nFor this to make sense you really need to get the &ldquo;Autonomous&rdquo; model, the only one that is designed for &ldquo;off-grid&rdquo; living and comes with solar panels and&nbsp;battery storage plus water storage and purification. That&rsquo;ll set you back 59,900 &euro; (about $63,461 USD) but hey, it does come with &ldquo;high quality minimalistic furniture&rdquo; which the best way we can think of to serve&nbsp;Ikea nesting instinct without saying the brand name. Yep, this ticks all the &ldquo;marketing to millennials&rdquo; boxes. We&rsquo;re kind of surprised it&rsquo;s not doing crowdfunding.\nSo where&rsquo;s the hack? Obviously this is a hard sell at 1,664 &euro;\/m2&nbsp;($538\/ft2). A project of this size and scope is well within the purview of a single, motivated hacker, and arguably a weekend project for a well-skilled team from a hackerspace. Tiny Houses started as a build-it yourself so that&rsquo;s already solved. We&rsquo;ve seen what it takes for hackers to add solar to their RVs, and experiments in home-built power walls. Water storage and purification is already solved and quite affordable at the home store.\nHas anyone built their own off-grid tiny house? If so, let us know what went into it. If not, what are you waiting for?",
