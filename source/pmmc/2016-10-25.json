I can hop on a call if you’d like.  \n\nGeneral comment: do you think there are enough bathrooms?  We’e talking about 40+ people on the 3rd floor, 10+ on first and second so ant any given time more than 60 people and three total toilets.  Feels low to me.  And we’d have issues when we host events.  *Is there a way to put stalls in the current bathroom footprint*?  Sorry if that’s the intention and I’m misreading…\n\nGeneral comment: Let’s assume glass walls to the conference rooms - I like this.  \n\nGeneral comment: I love all the storage options.  *Do you have examples of storage solutions you have in mind for this or you just portioning the space for them?*\n\nDesk shares:  *are you still thinking we can squeeze in any biz seats on 2nd floor or too forced?*\n- *What is the state of 2nd floor is it int he same place it was last week or are you currently working on that?*\n\n*Finally, for 3rd Floor, what if any compromises and shortcomings do you see in 3b  I like 3b…*",

Remember what ZGF did?  See what we did in Echo?  We can always block vision somehow later on down the line.\n- include notes on storage hight in your next doc\n- when you work on floor 1 and 2 next, do you think it’d be good to have an area to do spray painting and\/or photo shoots (like we saw at ZGF)",
