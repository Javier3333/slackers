Focused on incubating five various stage start ups and focused primarily on the 'business side of things' I'm wondering what some high value items that can fit like tabletop or table side for prototyping or iterating on prototypes would be. Like a scaled down version of our lab. What are things we would definitely want?  3D printers. Certain software suites. What comes to mind?",
