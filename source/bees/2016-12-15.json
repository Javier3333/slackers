The sounds and vibrations from over 40,000 honey bees will be live streamed into St. Mary's Church from a local beehive in Brackenhurst, Nottinghamshire. The renowned St. Mary's Choir will be accompanying BE throughout the whole performance. A state of the art 3D surround sound system has been commissioned for these performances, visual imagery from The Hive project will be projected onto the musicians and the church.<https:\/\/vimeo.com\/178600843>",

Collectively they created a soundscape for the multi award-wining sculpture known as ‘The Hive’ that was the centrepiece of the UK Pavilion at Milan Expo 2015 and is now sited at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London, U.K. The Hive highlights the decline of the world’s bee population by focusing attention on the importance of pollination for food production.",
