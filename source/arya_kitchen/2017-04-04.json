So far I’ve organized them by appliance, but wanted to run a few things by you. My current thoughts are that we should have a separate sign for each appliance that shows the core rules for each, the most important things that someone must know before using an appliance. In addition, we can have a fuller description of rules in the handbook. There is plenty that is not ideal about this approach, but I think it’s the best way to make sure people follow the rules. Posting this here so that others can form an opinion on it before we meet tomorrow. Also, some of my individual lists are short, which I think is a good thing, but also don’t want to forget anything important. Please add what you want to this document and edit anything to bold or not depending on how important you think it is. thanks! <https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1HpqMQZcHOsHEwVC-bNBs3mK87DV4LO09Ia3KlH_TjgY\/edit#heading=h.lxf6g05wy2rs>",
