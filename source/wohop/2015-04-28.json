                "text": "Processing materials in a magnetic field is an innovative and revolutionary means to change materials and structural properties by tailoring the microstructure. Properties, equivalent or beyond, can be achieved with significantly less energy than materials treated by conventional thermal methods. New properties can also be created by manipulation of phase stability through the application of a high magnetic field. Researchers at ORNL have developed various novel methods which offer improvements over current methods of creating materials with superior properties (structural, magnetic, electrical, optical, or acoustic). An apparatus and method have been developed for generating a magnetic field to improve the properties of the treated material through exposure to the magnetic field combined with thermal treatment. In addition, an apparatus and method have been developed for high magnetic field ohmically decoupled non-contact treatment of conductive materials in a high magnetic field to improve material properties.",
