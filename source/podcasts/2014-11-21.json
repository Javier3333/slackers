Jay believes [tweet ended there]\n\nJay is told he needs a story or he will go down for the murder too, maybe told Adnan was framing him. He comes up with the multiple stories.\n\nJay had no motive except the motive to lie about seeing Hae with Adnan to keep himself from going to jail. Police could have led him to car.\n\nThe Detective Sarah hired said -- They were building a case against Adnan, this looks perfect. Yeah, cause Jay was lying to save himself.\n\nBut I do believe Jay thinks Adnan did it. Or half believes. That's why he yelled, \"THEN WHO DID?\" Duh.. Roy Davis. DNA PUHLEASE..\n\nPolice told Jay \"It would help if someone corroborated your story\" BOOM. JENN. RT @TheMandyMoore I like your theory. But what about Jen?\n\nAlso why Steph won't talk. She knows Jay lied about seeing the body, but believes, like Jay, that Adnan did it &amp; Jay was saving himself.\n\nGuys, when Jay yelled, \"THEN WHO DID IT?\" It was so telltale. It's what he tells himself every time he feels guilty about lying about Adnan.\n\nJay has no fucking idea who did it. Adnan has no fucking idea who did it. Where the hell is Don and why isn't there DNA check on Roy Davis?\n\nJust a theory as to why Jay was involved at all. I mean, if Adnan could strangle Hae, he wouldn't have needed Jay to bury her.\"\n\n\n\"The Detective played dirty before... <http:\/\/www.courthousenews.com\/2013\/03\/05\/55427.htm> \"",
