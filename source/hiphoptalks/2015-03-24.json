                "text": "Atlanta rapper Future hasn't slept much this year. He's put out three mixtapes since October, is currently working on another, and at this rate is Lil B-level prolific, but with more songs that actually make it in the pocket. You don't even have to like Future to appreciate the insanity of that level of output. Especially when you take into account that it hasn't even been a full year since he put out his excellent studio album, Honest. In the time since, he's kept busy with a tour, the usual promotional obligations that come with an album, and lots and lots of new music.",
