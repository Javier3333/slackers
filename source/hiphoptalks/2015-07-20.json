Closer than it appears\n(Yea)\nAnd my peers they know that I don't fit the stereotype\nIf I don't practice what I preach then you can bury me in white\nAnd the fast life infected cuz it's full of parasites\nFine with sittin on the edge, I never been scared of heights\nMarried twice to the game ... But never to the fame\nFlirting on occasion, cuz it double up the change\nNever been a sucker for love or for the gain\nBut I been a fan of reaping the benefits for the pain\nBein drained after workouts, my asthma actin up\nMe and Hou in elementary school had to catch the bus\nThought it was normal for that age ... Helped us turn the page\nWent from Bein innocent kids to ready for the stage\nIt was written ... I'd never lie to yall\nAnd even on New Years I never drop the ball\nWas always a misfit from what I can recall\nNever been a walk of life for me, it's always been a jog..\nAnd ima tell you what you feed the mind ultimately grows\nI feed wisely and now I'm just reaping what I sewed\nConscious rap up in my speakers, Kendrick and jcole\nWhy they askin who the best rapper in the league when they know... Dame Lillard\nStop playin... I give to em straight\nCall me what you want, but you can never call me fake\nI'm a real college grad ... And my Pockets full of cake\nIf you don't like me... It's jealousy or a mistake\nI do it for the squad ... They already know\nCFG the clique and the jungle where we grow\nWe beating down barriers and kickin down the door\nSet the game on fire ...and let it burn slow",
