I've dropped more merch than mixes lately--including my SKRATCH FAN snapback collabo with DJ Q-Bert and the RAPFANxRTJDJ t-shirt--but it all starts with the music, so I had to put something together for the tour. \n\nThe project features tracks from all four acts, including Boots' Meow the Jewels remix and RTJ's late night television performance with TV On The Radio, as well as incredibly dope exclusives from Fashawn and Cuz Lightyear. Mike and El did some light hosting in classic WRTJ fashion, and the artwork was expertly handled by the great Ian Klarer, who also did the tour poster and last year's tour mix cover, among other things. \n\nStream or download the mix online, but if you're a collector and want a physical copy you'll have to come out to one of our tour dates and hit up the merch table, or catch me spinning at an afterparty. RTJ all day...salutes.\n\n<http:\/\/www.therapfan.com|www.therapfan.com>\n<http:\/\/www.djtrackstar.com|www.djtrackstar.com>\n<http:\/\/www.runthejewels.net|www.runthejewels.net>\n\nRun the Jewels feat Cuz Lightyear - Bust No Moves\n\nBoots - Aquaria\n\nFashawn - Ain't Me (Exclusive)\n\nCuz Lightyear - S.L.A.B. \n\nRun the Jewels feat Boots - All My Life\n\nFashawn feat Busta Rhymes - Out the Trunk Remix\n\nBoots - I Run Roulette\n\nCuz Lightyear - FRGN D$GN (Exclusive)\n\nBig Grams feat Run the Jewels - Born to Shine\n\nBoots - Howl Your Move\n\nCuz Lightyear - Trapaphobia\n\nFashawn - 100 Bars \n\nMeow the Jewels - Meowrly (Boots Remix)\n\nCuz Lightyear - Sags N Flags\n\nRun the Jewels &amp; TV On the Radio - Angel Duster (Live on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert)",
