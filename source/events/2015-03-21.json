The smell of empties is noticeable this time but isn’t too bad; has been worse in the past while doing weekend work\n2. when locking up overhead light should be turned out in the 360 area. if my sign to leave the lamp on over the 3d printer confused people let me know and I can make a new one\n3. UNCORKED router was unplugged. I put new labels on those power cords near the luxo\/instasand rig but this shouldn’t happen\n4. “Uncorked 390” router was unplugged. If we’re going to convert space we (I) should mount the access point to the wall so this doesn’t happen again. Also labeled this power cord “DON’T UNPLUG!!”\n5. We should label the various garage and recycling bins better. Everything is mixed in with everything else. Maybe have a separate (labeled) one for glass",
