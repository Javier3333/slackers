That said, I'm not sure what the cleaning crew can do about changing shifts ( <@U027PV4AP> ?) Should we have an event on a Saturday night (which would also be rare) it's probably best to keep it to Sunday. 2.  I completely misunderstood the sign and left the overhead light on. Won't happen again. 3 &amp; 4: I was not around during setup, so not sure how those were unplugged. (<@U026NB2U2> <@U027PV4AP> ?) 5. Wholly agree on this. This also might help with the smell of empties if we delegate alcohol containers to the sealed black trashcan or something.",
