                "text": "Hello Portland,   Come join us at the 17th DukeGEN Multi-city Networking Event at Uncorked Studios on Wednesday, November 19th, from 6-8pm.   The DukeGEN Networking Events provide a chance for entrepreneurial-minded Duke alumni and their guests to meet one another. They happen three times a year, and are voluntarily organized by Duke alumni, for Duke alumni, students, faculty, staff and friends. Since 2008, we&#39;ve held over 150 networking events with a cumulative total of 5000+ Duke attendees.   The Portland event will focus on stories of innovation and entrepreneurship by women in the Portland startup scene. We&#39;re honored to have several prominent members of the PDX technology scene share with us their founding stories, their product pitches, and lessons they&#39;ve learned along the way. Our guests include:   Kat Bobbit, Co-Founder of Stand In   Michelle Rowley, Founder of Code Scouts and Cultivate & Co   Mara Zepeda, Co-Founder of Switchboard   It&#39;s open to friends and family of Duke alumni, so come join us!     About The Duke Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative The Duke Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative aims to put ideas into action. We leverage the innovations that grow here at the university level to make tangible, perceptible change through entrepreneurship. Duke I&E does not displace the university’s time-tested mission of teaching and the creation of knowledge, but rather expands that mission to include the conversion of knowledge into real things and real actions to make a real difference in real people’s lives. Duke I&E re-imagines the role of the university in modern society, away from an institution whose work ends with the creation of ideas and toward one whose work begins with those ideas, toward an institution that seeks to solve in a practical way the great challenges of our time.   We&#39;re also proud to announce the creation of a set of articles by our colleagues at Duke Today, entitled &#34;Duke&#39;s Entrepreneurial Spirit&#34;.  We encourage you to check out this great series:    Location: Uncorked Studios  1001 SE Water Ave #350 Portland, OR 97214",
