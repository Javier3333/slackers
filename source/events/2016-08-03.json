                "text": "Simple Simple was started out of frustration with banks. They’re positive, passionate people who are serious about creating an experience for customers that’s unlike any other personal finance product you’ve ever used. Creative at Simple is a multidisciplinary group of makers, focused on bringing beauty to every aspect of Simple. They hope it shows. Simple chose to move to Portland a few years ago, because they stubbornly believe that banking can be an easy, friendly, comforting, and even fun experience. Simple sees Portland as a city committed to creativity, thoughtfulness, culture, and openness—just the place to make good on their big ideas. Join us as we tour Simple's new office space in the Central Eastside. We'll learn how Creative helps shape the full range of experiences, from Simple's new office to the internal and customer-facing products they craft. What are Studio Tours? Studio Tours is a quarterly event, developed by AIGA Portland. It provides the public with a rare guided tour around different creative studios in Portland. Discover for yourself what makes these companies tick. Space is limited and spots tend to fill up super quick. What kind of Studios? Past Studio Tours have included: Uncorked Studios, Nemo, W+K, Keen, Second Story, and Ziba. The tour is $10.00 for non-AIGA members and $5 for AIGA members. Spots are limited and fill up quickly.",
