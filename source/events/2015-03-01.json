The Hackster Hardware Weekend is a celebration of makers, open source hardware and the Hackster community across America. From Seattle to NYC and everything in between, we are hitting the road driving an original DeLorean DMC 12 to run the coolest Hackathon &amp; Meetup series of the year, with loads of hardware kits, amazing speakers, software freebies and great people. Best yet, you also get to hack our Time Machine. Update our DeLorean with the latest sensors, electronics, radios and data service. Make Doc Emmet Brown proud and hack to the future!   We bring our 2-day hackathon to Portland on March 7th and 8th. We&amp;#39;ll provide food, tools, soldering stations, and hardware kits from Intel and other companies for your team to hack with. You&amp;#39;re also encouraged to bring any hardware you might need. Each event will kick off with workshops where you&amp;#39;ll get to know each other and the hardware. Then you can hack your way to glory!  All ages and skill levels are welcome. Children under 16 should be accompanied by an adult.  Roadshow Partners   Portland Partners Check back soon!   Portland Hardware Intel Edison Spark Core Wunderbar   Portland Mentors and speakers Scott Hanselman, Application Architect and Evangelist at Microsoft Ryan Vinyard, Engineering Lead at Highway1 Portland Prizes $1500 Best use of AT&amp;T WebRTC  $1000 Best Overall App Award  3 Myo Bands - Best Use of Intel Edison Award $500 Best UI Award  $500 Best Mobile App  $500 Best use of Weather API Wunderbar - Best Use of Relayr Wunderbar   10 Metawear Boards - best use of Metawear alex[12:55 P ...and more to come, check back soon!
