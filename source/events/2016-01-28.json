Gaston Figueroa of Uncorked Studios will kick off this month's session with a demo on coding for animation. The 30 min. talk\/demo will focus on HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript. Tutors are knowledgeable in these and other stacks. After the animation demo, it'll be open lab as usual! Together with Code Oregon and generous volunteers from the #pdxtech community, Code Fellows is happy to host this event. Each month, our goal is a 6:1 tutor-to-learner ratio, and we provide free pizza and beverages.",
