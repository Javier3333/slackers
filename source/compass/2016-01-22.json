She finds a discovery experiment for stress and commits to 2 weeks of doing 20min of yoga every evening before bed. The app checks in on her stress and mood levels every day to see how she’s feeling. At the end of the two weeks, she does notice her stress levels have decreased, and her Compass app asks her if she noticed any results. While her in-the-moment reporting of her mood didn’t change much, the app notes that the yoga may have helped her sleep better. Compass recommends for her to create a goal to do yoga at least 3x a week for 20 minutes to see this continued benefit.",
