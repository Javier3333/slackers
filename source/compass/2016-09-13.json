Those include *1.0* (any effort to get us to launch), *Post Launch* (any effort towards the product that is slated to be developed after the March 1 release), and *Chameleon* (any effort towards the device including design, ux, and dev). \n\nSo, you’ll now see these as separate Harvest projects rather than falling all under the Compass bucket. As we move forward, please be conscious of what your work is considered and bill the time accordingly. If you’re unsure, ask us! We’re happy to help make sure you know which project to bill to, and of course provide access if you run into any issues. Thanks in advance!",
