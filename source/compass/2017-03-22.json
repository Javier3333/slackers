The format was similar to a retrospective, but instead of a simple set of definable questions, we progressed through a massive spreadsheet full of broken !#REFs and partially-visible text in an attempt to quantify our process and progress through a certain feature. At every step through the VSM™️ process, we were directed to respond to questions \"in general\" and \"on average\" rather than specifically addressing the item under discussion. Our facilitator answered simple questions about the meaning of a term in the spreadsheet with \"yes and no...\". It was the #AltFacts version of a retrospective and by the end of our 2-hour session, we filled out less than half of the massive spreadsheet. Huge :heart::100: appreciation to all the Uncorked teammates who endured this farce and gave honest, helpful feedback (which I predict will go to the same place where all our helpful feedback has gone in the past). Thank you for your hard work and please (publicly, noisily) fire me if my remarks are out of line. :slightly_smiling_face:",
