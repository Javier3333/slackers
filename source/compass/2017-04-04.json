Why? Because it wasn’t clear from onboarding what it was, and enrollment was a barrier to content.\n\n*Page 40*\n- Barriers to trying or using a discovery are:\n-- TIME: Trying a discovery takes more time than some have\n-- INTEREST: Some topics just don’t interest them; and some content within a topic is unappealing (especially food)\n- They don’t like having to download them before getting a sense for what they are\n- Instead, they want immediate access to the discovery through clear descriptions, more info, and short streaming videos (sample) prior to sign-up\n- For some, confusion included:\n-- Unclear about the concept during setup\n-- Overtime, it never become clear\n-- The process was not as clear as it could be:\n-- Didn’t understand that you need to ‘enroll’\n-- Unclear about ‘next steps’ in the process in general\n-- Unclear what would happen at the end of a discovery (“will it just go away?”)\n\n*Page 66*\n- Remove barriers (time &amp; interest) to experiencing discoveries, for example:\n-- Explain the discovery on the surface in clear, concrete terms\n-- Provide 10-30 second experience (streaming) prior to downloading or enrolling\n-- Offer downloading and enrollment after they have committed interest",
