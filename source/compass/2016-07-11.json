I posted the Compass schedule and the feature team breakdown on the wall to the right of courtyard so we can all reference it as needed and keep it there as a reminder.

Yellow sticky for UX and Visual - reminder we’re pushing to complete by end of this week 7\/15 and Blue for dev - showing the alpha date of 7\/26. Ping me if you have any questions.",
