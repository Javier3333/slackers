That you should make sure to be logging your time in Harvest to the correct project. I will be archiving Q3 projects after Monday in case there are last minute submitters, but *please be cognizant of which project you are billing to (1.0, post launch, or chameleon) and as of Monday make sure you are billing to the one that has the Q4 2016 label* Thanks!",
