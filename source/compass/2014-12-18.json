We are moving closer but it sounds like you are waiting for an updated agreement, and we are waiting for an updated statement of work.\n\nI think we should hold of starting the project until we are at least a little closer.\n\nWe can use the time today to try and converge on an agreement?  I think a ‘time and material’ approach is best for this, so maybe we can talk about estimates of what that would be?  We can sketch some key-date milestones?  Talk about how we think working might flow and be reviewed?\n\n1pm still works for me, and I think in-person might be a good idea.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\nSteve",
