After not really seeing anything on the visual side for 2 months :scream: , Scott was pleased to report that the meeting went extremely well. Sounds like Christian is onboard with our rationale AND our output. \n\n&gt;(of Christian)... liking the personality and human touches. The Motion was also helpful to envision the layouts.  All good.\n\nDoesn’t sound like much, but “all good\" is a pretty big deal. Nice work @phillip, @trent, <@U0MKH0BE0>. You guys are unbelievably talented!",
