It will not be stored on the the backend, so if a user deletes their app or goes back like 60 days the icons will likely be in a different order.\n\n2. *It’s confirmed that we can have the number animate up from the last number the user saw for launch*\nSo if I open the app and it says 10 active minutes, I put it away, go walk around, then open it I will see the number tick up from 10 to 15 (for example) as my pattern animates to show the new density.\n\nWahoo!",
