Anyone interested in me running a 1 shot sometime that week?  I'm leaving on Friday, so it'll have to be Mon-Thur...could also meet briefly during the day to help people create characters...it's a much easier process for ICRPG then 5e and since it's a 1 shot campaign we don't have to go into a lot of detail...any takers???",
