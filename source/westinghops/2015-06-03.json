Here are plans to build the melting furnace and instructions for basic pattern making and molding to get your shop project under way. Charcoal is the fuel and aluminum and zinc alloys are the metals to cast. None of the pulsation or roar associated with gas fired furnaces. Build your own molding bench and flasks. Make your own melting pots and most of the simple tools required. Discover how cheap and easy it is. Even if you already have a lathe and other equipment this simple foundry setup will greatly expand the capacity of your shop by providing you with a supply of cheap castings for your projects. Discover why so many shop hands say \"Metal Casting has opened a whole new world of shop experience\". Heavily illustrated with many photographs that will show you step - by - step how to build a foundry.",
