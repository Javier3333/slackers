At :42 there's an AE insert that can either stay as is, be re-shot live and sswapped in or we can decide to use all AE for Top Sweep.\n\nOnce we bottom out on this, this timeline can be exported as picture lock for google approval and a reference for Emily to update her Premier file.  \n\nWe'll also check back in on Emily's progress on post.  a heads up <@U0J6TE0CA> it’s my understanding all the previoulsy noted non-post work is done",
