Will be published sometime shortly after\n- Priority focus on end shots (lighting out and dolly back)\n- Get logo placeholde ron screen as elegantly but quickly as possible for this cut\n- Do not launch with FAKE Question :slightly_smiling_face:\n- Color correct on Angela’s finger, Dennis’ face and some flickering light\n- Consider the final viewport and compression specs as you need to prioritize any final details\n\nThe video went over really well today.  I think we nailed the progression of shots and story arc early on.  I’m feeling very good abotu the video\nFinally, I’m still following up with Google on approvals :confused:",
