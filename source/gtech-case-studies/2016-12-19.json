Previously, we were told we couldn’t do our own PR and kinda wanna ensure Google is OK with it before we include but I tend to be over caustious so I’m curious of your thoughts here.  \n2.  We have a ton of photos we can draw from for posting.  google approved oour social media messaging and some directional photos in the past.  I think we’re safe to include stuff that doesnt a )show anyone from IonTank b) show WIP\/unfinished structural stuff c) doesn’t include guest names.  Pick some out:\n\n<https:\/\/drive.google.com\/open?id=0B2saO1SetZcbZG9VR0x0V1R1VTQ>",
