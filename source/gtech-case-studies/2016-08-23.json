We still don’t have a PR person so that at this point, our video exercise is on hold.  We won’t be going to BrandLab to shoot on Aug 29 (next week) _but I think we will soon_.  Client’s championing on our behalf.  Further, video is on hold because I think we reached a logical stopping point.  I’m happy with what we’ve done thus far and where we are.  If you have ideas or feel like we should keep pushing in a certain area, I’m open - let’s discuss.\n\nWhen Justin’s back tomorrow, we can find ways to push through on the writing front.  Not blocked there.  \n\nMore to come.",
