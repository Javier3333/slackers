Wish we hadn’t discussed the focus on that last shot, because of course it’s what I see now. At same time, going back into some of the previous versions, it’s not too distant in terms of focus, so I’m not going to lose too much sleep over it. \n\nHonestly, the only thing I’m seeing that we’ve not already discussed is the opening transition from up close screens to the wood wall (around 5 sec mark) feels a half beat off. I know we’re trying to have that come in with the guitar line. It’s SUPER close, but is off just enough to have it be notable. To me it feels like that transition should happen with the guitar line vs. when the bass and stuff kicks in (which is how I think it’s happening now). \n\nBeyond that, I think we’re in fantastic shape. Thanks for all the hard work team!",
