These will include Black Lives Matter, Standing Rock Legal Defense Funds, Days for Girls, Environmental Defense Fund, Trans Youth Equality Foundation, Engender Health, Flint Kids, and more. I’ll post a tally at the end of every month of the donations and where they’ll be sent. If you have a charity that you see doing good in the world, please let me know and I’ll check them out!",
