This particular recipe for rich lamb ragù is not hard to make, but you still get the benefits of long, slow cooking. The active part is over quickly, and then then the ragù sits and simmers all afternoon in the oven or all day in the slow cooker. The result is a deliciously heady sauce, and the fragrance of deeply browned meat simmering with half a bottle of red wine!",
