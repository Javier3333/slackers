The sound was composed by Reeps One using only his voice as an instrument, while geometric shapes were used to embody the character of these sounds in visual form. The core audio-reactive visual elements were created using a mix of After Effects and Cinema 4D, while all of the additional shapes were placed individually in order to have more precise, frame by frame control of the size, shape, weight, and placement of each corresponding with the sound.",
