It would be great to talk through these during our meeting tomorrow and figure out what is needed on the development side to give us this amount of customization. I see all of these interactions overlapping with possible LED patterns on the hub (excluding the ability for the LEDs to chase each other in order), so I think whatever work we do to get the prototype in a state that it can demonstrate these interactions, it will also help us as we test interactions for the hub.",
