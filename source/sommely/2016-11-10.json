Once the pills are taken and a barcode is waved in front of the scanner,&nbsp;the WiFi connected system sends updates to friends and family members, keeping them abreast of the user&rsquo;s daily dosage.\nThe Las Vegas company, which launched the system back in April has closed a $3 million round of angel investor funding, courtesy of undisclosed parties. The money is set to go toward distribution for the $200 at-home medication device.\nPillDrill is also using the occasion to announce that it&rsquo;s scored an innovation award at next year&rsquo;s CES and added retired MedVenture Associates founder Annette Campbell-White to its board of directors.",
