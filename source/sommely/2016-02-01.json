Makes sense, and should be pretty straightforward to change. Those updates will give us months on a charge.\n* Spending today heads-down on getting BrandLab work finished, so no Sommely work for me. Slackable with questions.\n* Still waiting on hardware. We’re ready whenever they are. {yawn}\n* Big wins last week were from Lee on fade routines, so I’ll punt it to him...",
