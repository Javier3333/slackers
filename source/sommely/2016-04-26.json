With OSP, it’s really common that once the board goes through reflow, the ops burns off and the pads start contaminating.”\n* OSP refers to organic solderability preservatives. It's a transparent film on top of the copper to prevent oxidation which makes it easy to solder to. Solder wont bond to oxidation \n* A strong flux will work well but we will need to clean the flux off afterwards with a flux remover. Otherwise the flux could eat away other stuff that could lead to a latent failure.",
