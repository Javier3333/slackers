You'll get a chance to meet some of the winemakers who will be featured, taste their wine and take some home if you like (wine that is). The entry fee is $20 in advance and $25 at the door (which goes directly to supporting the documentary) includes tasting exceptional wines with the winemakers: Bertony Faustin and Ocean Yap-Powell of Abbey Creek Vineyard Jarod Sleet of Argyle Winery Jesus Guillen of Guillen Family Wines &amp;White Rose Estate  Laurie Lewis and Renee Neely of Hip Chicks Do Wine Andre Mack of Mouton Noir Wines Shuhe Hawkins &amp; Kate Larsen of Seven Sails Vineyard Nibbles are being provided by our good freinds at CravePDX and Cuisinieres Catering. Music by Bridgecity Music. The purpose of Red, White &amp; Black is to tell the story of minority winemakers in Oregon. To highlight those people who are deeply entrenched, have their livelihood on the line but somehow are missed by the press and not often included openly in the larger Oregon wine community. This is to tell the story of what life is like, what hurdles, acceptances, challenges and opportunities exist. To share what it is like to be a person of color or LGBT in a generally white, high brow industry.  At this stage, Red, White and Black is a for profit enterprise but our goal is simply to cover expenses (production, management, promotion) as we bring this important documentary to life.  Learn more about the documentary at the Red, White &amp; Black Facebook page.  Lets have some fun and get Red, White &amp; Black into production!",
