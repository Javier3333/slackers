                "text": "Just as &ldquo;social networking&rdquo; is a bland term that doesn&rsquo;t really capture the layers of what happens underneath (and on top of) social networking platforms, &ldquo;crowdfunding&rdquo; is a broader phenomenon than what the term and tools implies.&nbsp;Or so argue the guests on this episode of the a16z Podcast, Tilt co-founder and CEO James Beshara and a16z general partner Jeff Jordan with Sonal Chokshi.\nCrowdfunding isn&rsquo;t just about reaching a certain threshold to make something, but it&rsquo;s also about &ldquo;pre-commerce&rdquo; or &ldquo;pretail&rdquo; &mdash; the next evolution in commerce, which involves the ability to suss out demand before production and sell directly to consumers. Crowdfunding is also about &ldquo;social commerce&rdquo; &mdash; the ability to not only build community, but trigger collective action towards some goal. There&rsquo;s even a sort of Dunbar&rsquo;s number equivalent for crowdfunding, the tipping point at which the momentum of this collective action takes over (hint: it involves the magic number of 34%).\nBeyond crowdfunding, there are broader&nbsp;themes of economic change and behavior at play here &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s tolerance for waiting and buying something before it exists; a new type of scarcity and desire for experiential buying; or makers creating or co-creating things publicly, and even&nbsp;incompletely. All we know is that we&rsquo;re at a watershed moment of sorts &mdash; as evidenced by car manufacturer Tesla&rsquo;s pre-orders for its Model 3, which&nbsp;is not even going to be available for a few years. And yet&hellip;!",
