Unoptimized, we’re getting about 24hours of battery life\n* The gateway is now much smarter about scanning BLE for caps, and the caps are more visually responsive. It only takes a few milliseconds to turn them on now. \n* Though delivery of the final Star Flat boards are seriously delayed, we’re continuing with our development around integration with the gateway and power optimization. Our goal is to spend time next week working with a contact at Intel on power optimization and characterization.",
