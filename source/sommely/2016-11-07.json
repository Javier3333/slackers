Email a 1-2 page executive summary discussing the following aspects of the project: 1) the company and team 2) the market opportunity, value proposition, and customers 3) the technology\/innovation 4) the competition. Please note that responsiveness will likely be limited in the 2 weeks leading up to the solicitation deadline.”",
