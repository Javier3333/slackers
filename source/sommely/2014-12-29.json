        "text": "ok <http:\/\/somme.ly|somme.ly> reflow oven progress. reflowed a SOIC-8 onto a SMD breakout board. depositing the solder paste onto the pads without a stencil was interesting. Kind of dabbed it on and wiped it around. Solder mask was my friend. It was hard to gauge how thick the layer was or how even it was. The breakout board was smaller than the gaps formed by the wire shelving so I placed it on top of another circuit board. We'll want to avoid doing this in the future. Solder reflow was mostly sucessful. I'll try tweaking the profile to make it run slightly hotter.",
