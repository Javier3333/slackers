If we're going for clarity, we're going to run into the age-old debate over how clear an actual icon will be, and one for \"filter topic\" no less. I can find a ton of examples of widely used social networking sites that have buttons with text and buttons with icons in the same composition, so I don't think it's a real issue.",
