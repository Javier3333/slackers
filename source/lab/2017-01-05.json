                "text": "Strip Brushes are really useful for aiding in the capture of dust and chips being ejected from the milling process on the CNC machine (the router or spindle cutting process). The dust shoe that can be found on most of our CNC machines uses this strip brush. The strip brush encloses the cutting area and the vacuum creating an area of negative pressure, so the chips or dust will be carried directly to the vacuum end. The strip brush also serves as a wall or barrier that the chips will hit rather than getting ejected into the air. Just make a groove the same width of the rubber side of the brush and glue the brush in.",
