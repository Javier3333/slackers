Our tech world is full of amazing robots with amazing capabilities while our 3D printers are usually stuck in a box. I am hoping to do my part to peel that box back a bit and show off some possibilities. RepRap HELIOS is a 3D printer that uses a SCARA arm while at the same time has no moving steppers. It is tiny, light, quick, accurate, and has a massive print area.",
