My topline understanding and insight into how I’ll navigate the call -  Budget feels like 85k.  \nIf we can assume to get Elena down to 125\/hr she comes in at 40k.  Our revenue opp is 32k + mark up for her pass through (figure 10k) puts us at 82k.  But we have to figure out the project’s value to us.  \nFor Luke the value adds are: in discussing, we identified additional hypothesis which expanded the scope of our research for instance talking to jewlers and jewelry wearers so another audience segment as well as additional time for synthesis.  Also, we recruited a research team member who is an expert in the wearables space (gave keynote talks, worked at ziba)",
