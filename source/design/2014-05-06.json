It enables you to open web pages in Photoshop and saves you lots of time when re-designing or improving existing web page designs. Just open any page in the embedded browser and save the page as PSD with layers or as plain PNG image. Every web page element (every image, link, block, ...) will be rendered as separate, named layer. Layer groups will be created according to the site structure. It is the only Mac OS X browser screenshot app you will ever need, unique in its capability to capture web pages with layers.",
