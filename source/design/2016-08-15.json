                "text": "WATCH PEOPLE TRY TO BUILD IKEA FURNITURE ON DRUGS Ikea is often regarded as somewhat of a two-sided coin. On the one hand, you're getting your hands on some sleek and ultra-modern furniture at an affordable price. On the other hand, you're left to piece together the miscellaneous legs, screws, and slabs of particleboard and bring that sophisticated dresser to life. And that's not even mentioning the journey through Ikea itself (watch this clip from Louie.) If you fail, you may never bounce back. But if you succeed, the world suddenly feels like a cool Baltic breeze. WNW Members Hunter Fine and Alex Taylor decided to take the stakes even higher and create Hikea, a web series filming people high on drugs while attempting to build Ikea furniture. The hopelessness of the subjects in the first two episodes is hilarious, as they try to overcome not only the hieroglyphic instructions but the debilitating effects of LSD and Shrooms.  To truly test your inner fortitude, skip the marathon you've been training for and attempt to build a Godmorgon or Malm or Knutstorp. And when you're finished, put your feet up on one of those Jordbros and watch an episode of Hikea to witness what could have gone wrong.
