Even a day later, I'm still really quite excited about the range of material you all produced in such a short amount of time. It's inspiring and a friendly reminder for me to a) make the time to do more design and b) step the fuck up. \n\nIf only for my own enjoyment, I'd love to put all current designs, even in rough form, in a common place where we can collectively think about it a bit. I'm going to make a basecamp project and invite everybody. No real agenda beyond having things there, thinking about the stickers, thinking about whatever we didn't think about yesterday. \n\nBe on the lookout!",
