I think she is generally pretty new at it but expressed interest in talking to somebody who had more experience as a designer about what a career in design looks like, where to draw inspiration, etc. Essentially, she kinda wants to pick somebody’s brain about design to see if it really is what she’s interested in. Would anybody be willing to grab a coffee with her sometime? I could give her a tour of the office and I think she’d be happy even to get a half hour of face-time to ask questions\/chat.",
