They're private, they're _usually_ on spec, and shouldn't be represented as \"formal work.\" As someone who has spent a great deal of time searching google images for pitch decks, I do agree that a subscription service would help to secure better quality images more quickly. But ethically? There's probably bigger fish to fry...\n\nPersonally, I think the problems with font licensing and \"sharing\" is a FAR worse crime of ethics.
