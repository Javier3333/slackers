                "text": "An Evening of Conversation with Simple presented by Designspeaks  True disruption requires reinvention. But what does creative destruction look like when the thing that needs improving is an antiquated industry - banking? Designspeaks brings Simple CEO Josh Reich and Creative Director Ian Collins together for an earnest discussion about how design-thinking - intentional, creative, structured work - is vital in keeping the company nimble, and how that focus has propelled the startup&amp;#39;s rise to key industry player at the intersection of technology and design. This Designspeaks sponsored by 52 Limited and Simple. Ticket includes the presentation, hors d&amp;#39;oeuvres, hosted bar, and a limited edition commemorative poster. Doors open at 6 pm.  DESIGNSPEAKS exists to explore design within the multidisciplinary: architecture, brand, communications, experience, film, fashion, graphic, industrial. We establish an interface within the context of real life, supporting the most compelling regional voices in design, and talk through to the heart of the practice.",
