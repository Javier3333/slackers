                "text": "Google Cardboard&amp;rsquo;s biggest appeal has always been its accessibility. Heck, they send the headsets out with the newspaper. Zeiss is taking things in a different direction with the One Plus (not to be confused with the less spacey OnePlus), a $129 VR headset for smartphones that features a premium build and, naturally, the company&amp;rsquo;s high-end optics.\nThe wearable features a tray that accommodates smartphones between 4.7 and 5.5 inches, courtesy of an adjustable system that holds the handset in place. The One Plus&amp;nbsp;also features a lot of padding, making it comfortable for long, battery draining sessions.\nThe key, of course, are those lenses, which offer up a sharp image without requiring any focal adjustment. They also do a solid job of removing the distortion around the edges of the images that you often get with similar devices. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly one of the better Google Cardboard experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve had thus far.\n The headset ships with a cube that offers a neat augmented reality experience (which utilizes the phone&amp;rsquo;s unobstructed camera, serving as a sort of proof of concept for app developers. The One Plus&amp;nbsp;is compatible with Android and iOS devices, and the company is talking up a DJI app that offers a first-person experience from the drone. The company is also working on compatibility with Google&amp;rsquo;s Daydream.\nIt&amp;rsquo;ll hit retail in August.",
