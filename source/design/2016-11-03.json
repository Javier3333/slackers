I highly recommend everyone (definitely for design team, but great for the whole team) view these. This is a perfect use of AVP time to learn a tool that will benefit our workflow on future projects. I’m only a few videos in, but so far the videos are very comprehensive and digestible.  <https:\/\/www.switchtosketchapp.com\/>",
