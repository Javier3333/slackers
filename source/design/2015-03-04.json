Lots of \"we want the web to behave like a slidedeck.\" Static, controllable (by us) and predictable (to us). Unfortunately, the web is the wrong medium for that. You could fake it. Make it behave like an iPhone app or a powerpoint but that comes with a high UX and usability cost to our users. Seems like a huge missed opportunity since that same effort could be used to make web products awesome by using its strengths and not weaknesses to differentiate a design. &lt;\/rant&gt;",
