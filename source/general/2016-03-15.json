        "text": "<!channel>: I’m incredibly excited to share an announcement with you. It is time, once again, for us to celebrate the majesty that is the Name of the Year. Name of the Year, or NOTY, was founded in 1983 on an Ivy League campus. Its mission has remained unchanged: to discover, verify, nominate, elect and disseminate great names. These visionaries scour police reports, newspapers, sports rosters, etc. for the best names in the world and create a tournament bracket to identify the ultimate name of the year.\n\nAnd while the yearly release of this bracket has become one of our favorite moments at Uncorked, it has also completely de-railed productivity as we collectively pour through the entries, making our necessary comments on slack. This year, we want to do something a little different.\n\nInstead of posting the link to slack now and ruining our workday, we want to experience the magnificence together over drinks at happy hour. *I would like to officially invite all of you to said happy hour, Wednesday, March 16th at 5:30pm at the Slammer Tavern.*\n\nWe will be revealing the names, matchup by matchup, allowing plenty of time for discussion and commentary. We’ll then ask you to pick your winners for cash and prizes. For more questions, or to participate, visit <#C0STTK4HE> and we’ll send you an invite to happy hour. We really really hope to see you there, and please… if you stumble across this year’s bracket, don’t spoil it for the rest of us!\n\nYours,\nAbby, Melissa, and Matt\n\nFor additional context, here is some background about NOTY\n<http:\/\/www.nameoftheyear.com\/2007\/02\/name-of-year-started-innocently-enough.html>\nAnd here’s the NOTY Bracket from 2015 who’s winner was Amanda Miranda Panda.\n<http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/2XJPAAF.png>",
