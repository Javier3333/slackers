        "text": "All, \n\nI’m excited to be back, and to welcome our newest Design Director, Leah Shea to the team. She has a world of experience, working as a product designer at really amazing places like Moment and ustwo. We’re thrilled to have her, not just for that history, but for how she thinks about the work we all do as well as the work that Uncorked could be doing. That’s actually one of the core things we’re going to have her focus on — Helping us look beyond the clients and projects that we currently have. We’ll be working to help define and build future work at Uncorked.  \nThere’s obviously so much more, but for now I wanted to officially welcome Leah to the team. Please join us and say hello over donuts at Walnut sometime around 10:30.",
