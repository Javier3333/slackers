If you’re in the first group, I’m not offended, but if you’re in the second group, this is your reminder! I’d love if everyone could take a second and really think about what you do here. Beyond what your job title says you do, I want to know what you _really_ do, for many of you it’s much more than what your job title says OR it is part of your job description and I just don’t know what all your job entails. Anyway, I think it’d be great to bring to light what everyone does around here every day. Feel free to toot your own horn a little bit!",
