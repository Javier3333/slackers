In addition we will have two presentations from the local VR companies, a keynote from Paul Reynolds(formally of Magic Leap), and lots of VR demos to experience.Come out for an amazing night of community building, VR experiences, learning about the local scene. We will have multiple VR experiences to demo and a few door prizes!Presenters: Michael Balzer is an engineer, developer, designer and inventor of a number of technology products. He began in the 90’s with products like ‘Perfect Sound’, ‘Perfect Vision’, and ‘Chroma Key’ to more recent products like ‘4eyes’, ‘NEODiMOUNT’ iPhones cases &amp; accessories, and ‘NEODiVR uPLAy’ - the first fully immersive VR viewer you can put in your shirt pocket.

Sven Mesecke The PDX Hub - \"Blending the history and growth of Portland's creativity and technology talent into community success within Virtual and Mixed Realities\" Sven is a Co-founder of WirelessVR chipmaker, Nitero, transplanted from Austin to Portland in 2015 to explore further opportunities in our unique ecosystem. He will discuss from a relatively recent outside perspective, why Portland's history and talent pool within the arts and creative spaces, when combined with the presence of solid technology giants, global brands and start-up spirit, provides an excellent platform for success throughout the community in the emerging Reality spaces. As well, he will address a common question heard upon arrival for incoming talent pursuing VR and AR growth - \"Why Portland\"? Keynote: Paul Reynolds moved to Portland in 2016 after a 3 year run at Magic Leap as Senior Director of developer tools and apps. He will be speaking about “Mixed Reality 101” and how VR\/AR technologies are tapping into human perception in ways we have never seen before and what it could mean for our future.
