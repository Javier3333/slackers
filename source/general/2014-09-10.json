As we're thinking about positioning - the powers that be asked that I get some feedback from all of you. I was hoping to connect with all of you in person, but I've been fighting off a cold and didn't want to get you sick. So, if you have a few minutes this afternoon or sometime this week, could you DM me your thoughts on 1.) What is Uncorked Studios to you? 2.) Where do you think we should be focusing our energy? (mobile, hardware, strategy etc...) 3.) Do you have a dream project\/client? 4.) Any other ideas and\/or thoughts on the matter.  Doesn't need to be polished, no wrong answers or stupid ideas - just gathering some data and thinking big picture.  Thanks so much and let me know if you have any questions!",
