We're going to be doing some seating rearrangement in the near-term – the success of some recent working models has reinforced how valuable constant cross-functional collaboration can be, and how we can arrange our space to facilitate. We're still working out the details of the [re]arrangements, but our hope is to get all disciplines a bit more intermixed and have members of some of the larger project teams in closer proximity to one another. Additionally, this lets us prototype how we might arrange things at 811, so keep feedback and concerns coming my way. More to come, but get excited for some fresh neighbors!",

Elise Hermann is joining us on contract to help us with recruiting. Elise was most recently at CrowdCompass and is known for being engaged with the portland tech community, and always having the kind of energy and positivity that draws people in. We’re really grateful for her help as we tackle a backlog of tech hires and recruiting in general. She’ll be sitting in the roller table pod in 390 at least this week (Charles announcement notwithstanding). Say hi to her tomorrow! or today on slack (<@U1FTVHWR5>) if you prefer. :slightly_smiling_face:",
