You have time to prep! \n\n2) We also put some gaffers tape on the floor in the public space. Sadly, it is the only tangible reminder of where we put the lights to recreate the photos for our site. So please please please leave the tape where it is! It's super helpful and time saving when we have it there, and has been removed each time we do this in the past. <@U027PV4AP> if we could share that thought with our cleaning crew as well, it's much appreciated. \n\nThanks everybody!",
