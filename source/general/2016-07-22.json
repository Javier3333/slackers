Please be kind to Ally, Kate, Elise (H, Cramer is on her own), Avery, Charles, Marcelino, and everybody else who picks up our duties. and try to carry the torch a little more than usual for office stuff. Also, we are trying to avoid having to print checks next week, waiting til Monday August 1st. This should not affect contractors paid through Gusto but would affect expense reimbursements. Message me privately if anything special comes up!",
