So I apologize if your lunch accidentally got the ax, I got a little aggressive and sometimes sacrifices must be madeâ€”but it was mostly food with strange new creatures growing on it or things frozen to the back wall of the fridge. (Let me know if your lunch went missing!) Be sure to check the dish rack for your tupperware to take home today and please check the remaining leftovers, some are questionable and shouldn't be there too much longer. Thanks!",
