(In addition to being a mandatory meeting - this should be an amazing opportunity to learn about what the state is doing, what you can do to prepare yourself and your families, and  begin to think about how we might put Uncorked’s resources toward helping inform our neighbors and friends. Looking forward to seeing you there.)",
