The password is now the w4t3r4v3 one for the UNCORKED network. Printing and the NAS both work from the UNCORKED network now. The only thing that might need improvement is the handoff between the two access points. Since they are so close together, the first\/nearest one you connect to might not release you when you get closer to the other one. You can always turn off your wireless and back on to try to connect to the optimal access point if this happens.",
