I've put a meeting on the team calendar, and this will be a bring your own lunch event. \n\nThe movie is called Bulkland. It's all about the manufacturing and sales process of things that go in dollar stores around the world. While it's not explicitly related to what we're building here, it's an example that highlights the complexities and systems behind everything we're up to. We watched it over break and loved it. You're welcome to attend! \n\n<https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LWMSuzdXsbA>",
