Gaston Figueroa of Uncorked Studios will kick us off with a demo on coding for animation.  Gaston is a Front-end developer and a Creative Engineer at Uncorked Studios. He has a passion for user friendly interactive experiences, data visualization and creative code. About the talk: The 30 min. demo will focus on getting started with web animations. We will look at specific examples to explore various tools, languages (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS), and techniques we can use to produce and optimize web animations. After the animation demo, it'll be open lab as usual! Together with Code Oregon and generous volunteers from the #pdxtech community, Code Fellows is happy to host this event. Each month, our goal is a 6:1 tutor-to-learner ratio.",
