The TL’DR is that with VR\/AR\/MR we have an opportunity set the baseline design. The present is the prisoner of the past. Decisions we make today, we’ll be beholden to going forward. Like the mouse pointer. Or that roads are the sizes of 2 horses asses. If we’re not careful and don’t set the appropriate baseline, we can end up with an awful amalgamation of mobile design troupes, gamification, notifications and more. A hyper reality. But if we make a conscious decision today, we can build a VIRTUAL REALITY that is zen, pleasant and promotes a sense of belonging. Which after all is the thing that humans long for most, belonging. Well worth giving the whole thing a watch. <https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_AnSGChSSzw&amp;feature=youtu.be>",
