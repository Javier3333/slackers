                "text": "“Blurring the Lines with HoloLens”a talk with Joshua Walton (Microsoft) Our latest speaker for The Cookie Shop is Joshua Walton, principle designer for Hololens—the world’s first self-contained, holographic computer. With the arrival of Hololens and other VR devices, more and more discussions about design are happening, as the lines between physical and digital begin to blur. “Blurring the Lines” will frame up important questions about Mixed Reality and how we might approach design for this new medium. Join us. September 30 at Instrument HQ. Doors open at 5:30pm, talk starts at 6:00pm.",
