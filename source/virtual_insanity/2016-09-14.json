They are a non-profit dedicated to advancing digital storytelling and they’ve recently been highly focused on AR\/VR. They’re toying around with running workshops to introduce people to the different technologies\/platforms and how to build\/design for them. They’ve done a bunch of workshops with developers but are really interested in working with designers and understanding how these tools might fit into a design process. I am going to see if we can arrange another workshop (we’d have to pay for it, not sure how much yet) because I think that a lot of folks would find it really fun\/interesting. I played around with a number of different applications but this one (or something like it) seem incredibly useful for prototyping\/sketching in 3d. Was thinking about BrandLab a lot.",
