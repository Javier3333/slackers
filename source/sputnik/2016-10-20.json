Doesn’t go outside without other people because she’s been threatened and harassed. (edited)\n \nBelieves economics play into the problem. equity is the value of someones shares and the most valuable shareholders are business and property owners. She believes the city has valued property owners over black neighborhoods. When asked what a economic solution would be in a capitalist system she said the government should make sure agencies they partner with are using their dollars effectively. She quoted a review where the city of Portland received an F for accountability of agencies. Her opinion is that when agencies receive government money to improve the lives of citizens those citizens should be surveyed to judge the effectiveness of those programs. Also agencies should account for every government dollar spent.",

Teressa would like citizens to be able to evaluate every encounter with police to report abuse and unprofessionalism. (edited)\n\nIt’s difficult to organize the black community in portland because gentrification has separated traditional neighborhoods. The church which is the traditional center of the black community is inactive and in some cases controlled by the government.\n\nShe is working to end closed police hearings.\n\nFelt the city hall incident was a set up. 17 protesters were invited to give public testimony and were beaten and removed from city hall by 70 police in full riot gear. Don’t Shoot PDX is suing the police department and are confident they will win.\n\nBlacks should know their rights and take legal action when encountering police.\n\nMinorities and poor people are the same thing.\n\nShe is a native Portlander. Her grandparents owned 2 restaurants. The patrons were harassed and extorted by the police. Once police officers threw dead opossums at the restaurants door which was a southern lynching threat. She said they made a complaint to the then black police commissioner (1981-Charles Moose?)\n\nThings have gotten much worse for blacks in portland in the last 30 years because of gentrification and political power of police. Would like to partner with us on a TED talk she’s doing next year perhaps to create a prototype around the 7 pillars of non-violent action",
