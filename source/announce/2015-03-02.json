He's not just slapping his name on other people's designs.  It was pretty lame for someone to criticize his \"aura\" and his \"attitude\" as being diva-ish...at New York Fashion Week, the existence of which is to promote diva designers (male and female).  And for the record, I think his music has gone down the tubes and his Grammy behavior is bratty and embarrassing, but I kind of think he had a right to stick up for himself on this one.",
