So in order to satisfy the cartographer in all of us, Holly spent the last 3 years compiling and uploading over 1,000 maps of our national parks to his website,&amp;nbsp;npmaps.com.\nThe project, which followed the government shutdown in 2013, was the result of childhood memories. Holly says he drew his inspiration from the maps national park rangers gave him as a child upon entry to the park.\n&amp;ldquo;Receiving that map means I am now in a crown jewel; I am experiencing the best of what America has to offer and what this nation most values.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Matt Holly, NPS\nThe traditional map of Mount Rainier National Park\nAs of now, the database hosts 1,053 high resolution maps of all 59 national parks. Those maps include 3D depictions, color coded depth maps, as well as your basic topo maps. Whatever the case, if you plan on heading to a national park this summer you should check out his site first.\nFind the entire collection here: <http:\/\/NPMaps.com|NPMaps.com>",

                "text": "“Agile-ish” - Effectively integrating aspects of agile methodologies into a creative production process It's been a while since we talked agile, so let's revisit \"agile-ish\" where we discuss the elements of agile that can be applied in service-based digital businesses. This includes things like: Can you make a sprint-based project cycle work with project deadlines and fixed scopes?Can points-based estimation work when it comes to planning projects?Will selling agile-structured projects ever be the norm in the digital industry?How can design and the other non-development portions of the project lifecycle become more agile?Join us June 14th, 2016 at 5:30PM for pre-event networking. The evening's content kicks off at 6PM. Location: We'll be getting together at Parliament this month. They're a first-time host and are excited to share their space with us for the evening!",
