The placement of the appendages is determined by the same method nature uses in pinecones and sunflowers.  The rotation speed is synchronized to the strobe so that one flash occurs every time the sculpture turns 137.5º—the golden angle. If you count the number of spirals on any of these sculptures you will find that they are always Fibonacci numbers. \n\nFor this video, rather than using a strobe, the camera was set to a very short shutter speed (1\/4000 sec) in order to freeze the spinning sculpture.\n\nJohn Edmark is an inventor\/designer\/artist. He teaches design at Stanford University.\n\nVisit John's website here: <http:\/\/web.stanford.edu\/~edmark\/>\nand Vimeo site: <https:\/\/vimeo.com\/johnedmark\/videos>\n\nLearn how he made these sculptures here: <http:\/\/www.instructables.com\/id\/Blooming-Zoetrope-Sculptures\/>\n\nAnd more about the Pier 9 Artist in Residence program here: <http:\/\/www.autodesk.com\/air>",
