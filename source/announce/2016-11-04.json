Prior to Uncorked I spent 12 years turning people into cyborgs in the medical device industry and I have a lot of stuff for show and tell. There are a lot of design, software, and manufacturing implications to talk about. Thank you to <@U0HS41J3Y> for setting up and <@U0XJFPSRL> for suggesting I do this. Also there wont be any blood and gore, but there can be if you ask nicely.",
