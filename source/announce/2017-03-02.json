As such, the company thinks it’s important to have a POV on *next Wednesday’s “Day Without a Woman”* because we know how impassioned the entire studio is about these sorts of issues.\n<https:\/\/www.womensmarch.com\/womensday>\n\nSo… we are thinking that you may want to support Uncorked's 47% women (!!)  and all the women of Portland? If so, please check out my email with 3 ways you can do that between NOW and next WED. Any Qs let James or I know!",
