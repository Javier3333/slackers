Check status: yep, still cooking!”\n\nPortland could be a hub of IOT development because it has certain things going for it.\n\n“We’re good at apparel, semiconductors, we love food, we’re good at healthcare, and we enjoy the great outdoors.”\n\nNo other city has this overlap. He is excited to see the Southeast innovation quadrant connect to PSU, OHSU, the Schnitzer campus and the central east side around OMSI, and proposes the Portland Modern Manufacturing Collective can help that happen.",
