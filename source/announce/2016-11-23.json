        "text": "&gt;What role did Morton Salt play, and what is #WalkHerWalk\n_Morton Salt have recently launched a campaign to support a group of people who are bravely making a positive difference in the world. They’ve pledged funding and assistance to incredibly inspiring and effective young innovators who are tackling difficult issues like the global water crisis, the plight of young female refugees, systemic failures in arts and music education, and children’s health and wellness education. The slogan for this campaign is #WalkHerWalk, a reference to the girl in their iconic logo, and you can learn more about the innovators and the many facets of the campaign at_ <http:\/\/MortonSalt.com\/WalkHerWalk>.\n\n_Morton was moved by the message of “The One Moment,” and felt it captured the spirit of what they are trying to do with #WalkHerWalk, so they reached out to us and asked if we were interested in making art with their salt – a video that could fly the banner for their initiative. We were impressed with their efforts to support positive change, so we proposed this idea, and together we collaborated to bring this video to life._",
