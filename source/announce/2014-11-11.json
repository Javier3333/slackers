                "text": "Crowdfunding, the practice of pooling small amounts of funding from a network of supporters, has been experiencing a steady increase in existing platforms worldwide. It is estimated that in 2014, crowdfunding will add over 270,000 jobs and more than $65 billion to the global economy. What is this new phenomenal trend, and how has it managed to change the scope of entrepreneurship and business financing as we know it?  Drive Oregon&#39;s November event will take an in-depth look at the topic of crowdfunding and how it can support companies in the electric vehicle industry. What do businesses need to know about crowdfunding? Which firms can benefit the most? What are the strengths and challenges of this strategy? What are some key tips on having a successful crowdfunding campaign? We are bringing in two crowdfunding experts to share their experiences and give an inside look at the world of crowdfunding in Portland and beyond.  Our speakers will be: Lou Doctor, President of Crowd Supply  Over the span of his career, Lou has acted as the financial advisor on over 25 M&A transactions totaling over $500M and founded ten technology and e-commerce companies that will do combined total of over $40M in annual sales this year. Lou is now President of Crowd Supply, a unique new Portland startup that enables crowdfunding for independent manufacturers. Among its many campaigns, Crowd Supply has worked with companies in the electric bicycle industry to help them  promote and finance their business ventures.  Brad Davis, General Manager at EcoSpeed Brad started at EcoSpeed in 2007 on a volunteer basis and has worked from the    ground up to become General Manager. He had fallen in love with the machine and all  the social, environmental, and physical implications that electric bikes offer the world. His energy is involved with all the operations of the company, including its very successful crowdfunding campaign that sought $75,000 in funding and received $99,292 instead.   Attendance is FREE for Drive Oregon members, $25 for non-members. We will provide Oregon wine, beer and light refreshments at no additional charge. Space is limited, so don&#39;t delay - reserve your ticket now!",
