From creating an interactive sandbox that playfully changes color in response to each user’s gestures to building robotic arms that respond to facial expressions, our interns have run the gamut on experimentation. But an internship at Uncorked involves more than just internal or self-driven projects, as some of our interns have also had the chance to contribute to our larger endeavors, such as helping to build Sommely (an intelligent IoT wine tracking system) or participating in the development of our latest installation for Google’s BrandLab team.",
