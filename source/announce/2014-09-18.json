The lines stop half way through the big room (where you see a bunch of cat5 cable cut off in the ceiling). A good topology for internet routing would have individual runs to each place where we ultimately want them, and in the new space we're still defining that. But up until we have a hardwire in the new space, at least one, we're relying on getting wireless signal to the space. The Clear modem is in the corner to help but it is limited on bandwidth so its not a very good solve, even temporarily. Note that it only supports a few connections directly, so use the belkin router attached to it (which is probably a better wireless router by a lot anyway) <@U0260V1BX>",
