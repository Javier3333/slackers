The discussion was really interesting, really intense, and the reactions were quite varied!\n\nThe one thing we realized is that while attitudes are certainly evolving, weed still carries with it some amount of controversy. (We've had similar conversations as a business around doing work political campaigns or doing work for the Defense Department.)  \n\nAs a part of understanding how we as a business \"feel\" about this emerging industry - it is of the utmost importance to understand how YOU feel, as an individual.  \n\nYour responses are private, but I will share the aggregate data out to the whole team.\n\n<https:\/\/goo.gl\/forms\/AbBQ93ZpJIBlW2uQ2>",
