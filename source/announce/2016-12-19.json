You're welcome to it, and I'm happy to give any pointers if needed. \n\nThat said, if you use any of the more complex equipment, such as studio lighting, please please be sure to return everything to the state you found it in. This includes any of the light modifiers, remote triggers (esp. for batteries), etc. \n\nLet me know if you ever have questions on any of this stuff. Happy to help, and really excited that we are able to put all this equipment to good use. \n\nThanks!",
