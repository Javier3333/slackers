My daughter and I just crashed what we thought was an Italian meetup at the park but ended up being an large Italian-American family picnic. Turns out they're all descendants from a family of 5 Italian body-builder brothers who emigrated to America around 1940. Fun!\n\nItalians are so friendly, they kept asking me to stay for lunch and show up to their Wednesday family gatherings.",
