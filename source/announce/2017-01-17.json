In case you haven’t heard, we just launched an amazing site to raise the voices of women who can’t make it to the Women’s March on Washington in conjunction with Ziba and our friends at Wildfang. \n\nThis is a shining example of acting on the passions of the Studio - particularly to support civic tech, and diversity and inclusion issues specifically. An enormous thanks to the core team - <@U167FL70V> , <@U243UT96G> , <@U1S5GKTHQ>  (and <@U026PHQ3J> &amp; <@U026NB2U2>), as well as the dozens of others who supported this effort over the last month.\n\nHelp us spread the word by sharing our tweet, posting your own stories, and encouraging your wives\/sisters\/friends\/aunts\/nieces\/bartenders to do the same. We just posted a blog about the launch, and will have a follow up about the “How” in a couple of days.\n\n<https:\/\/twitter.com\/uncorkedstudios\/status\/821418999284043776>\n\nThanks for your help in getting the word out and thanks to the team for making this happen!",
