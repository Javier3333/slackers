I know that many of you are hurt, scared, worried, and angry. All of these things are important and valid. I will also say that the possibility exists that some of you are none of those things, and that’s okay too.\n\nfirst off, please know that if you feel “off” and need anything today. we have resources. there is FTO. i know that the compassionate and amazing  <@U2DTF0B6Y>  is happy to talk one on one. I am too. in fact, I imagine most of the executive team are here for hugs, for coffee, or for support of all sizes and shapes.\n\n<@U026NB2U2> would love to say something at 9:45 - in the social space - for those who want to come together. and afterwards, i would also like to run a semio-session today right afterwards in the social space  for those who want to share concerns, questions or ideas for action - that will be a safe place to come together and look towards the future.",

We are not going to stop this battle. Your fight is not over. I will be part of this with you. I do not believe, and have never believed, that that vile man and his ilk (some 50-ish percent of the country by latest counts) represented the future of this world. We will continue to fight that relic of a false history of perfection for all time. I will personally continue to make this inequality a priority and to never ignore it. It is not my burden to bear, it is yours - daily, minutely - I can only promise you all that I will shoulder that burden as much as I can, that I will fight to my last breath for that burden to be lifted. It is front and center now. This battle isn’t over, it wouldn’t have been no matter the outcome, but from this bullshit - my resolve to make this right is strengthened. I hope yours is too.",

And where the words of women are crying to be heard, we must each of us recognize our responsibility to seek those words out, to read them and share them and examine them in their pertinence to our lives. That we not hide behind the mockeries of separations that have been imposed upon us and which so often we accept as our own: for instance, “I can’t possibility teach black women’s writing– their experience is so different than mine,” yet how many years have your spent teaching Plato and Shakespeare and Proust? Or another: “She’s a white woman, what could she possibly have to say to me?” Or, “She’s a lesbian, what would my husband say, or my chairman?” Or again, “This woman writes of her sons and I have no children.” And all the other endless ways in which we rob ourselves of ourselves and each other.\n\n      We can learn to work and speak when we are afraid in the same way we have learned to work and speak when we are tired. For we have been socialized to respect fear more than our own needs for language and definition, and while we wait in silence for that final luxury of fearlessness, the weight of that silence will choke us.\n\n      The fact that we are here and that I speak not these words is an attempt to break that silence and bridge some of those differences between us, for it is not difference which immobilizes us, but silence. And there are so many silences to be broken.```",

Starting today, we&rsquo;ll begin to roll out a fresh look and feel on the web that showcases Pandora&rsquo;s vibrant branding, includes our latest features, and brings exciting new ways to discover and engage with your music.\nWelcome to the new web listening experience:\n\nImmersive Now Playing View:&nbsp;Not only will you never lose sight of what you&rsquo;re currently jamming to with the fixed player bar at the bottom of your screen, but you&rsquo;ll also be able to visually experience and interact with the music in new ways. The album art is front and center, bold and beautiful, with additional backstage access to the artist&rsquo;s lyrics, tour dates, bios, and more.\n\nImproved Navigation:&nbsp;It&rsquo;s easier than ever to manage your music with seamless navigation between past, present, and future listening. From what&rsquo;s currently playing, to station creation and organization, and the history of your favorite tracks, the updated features across the platform allow you to easily control your listening experience.\n\nReplays and More Skips:&nbsp;For Pandora Plus listeners, hit the replay button to start your favorite jam from the beginning or experience that newly discovered song again. It could be the last song you heard, or you can go back in your listening session and replay a track. Press skip to get to your next favorite track. For those of you who want to stick with the free, ad-supported Pandora, you&rsquo;ll be getting some new features as well. Whenever you run out of skips or want to replay a track, just watch a video ad to get those extra features for added control over your experience.\n\nTour Dates:&nbsp;Love what you heard and want to experience it live? Access to local shows is now just a click away. We&rsquo;re serving upcoming tour dates for all of your favorite acts in Now Playing and the artist pages.",
