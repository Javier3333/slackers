Hey friends, I am working on Uncorked tax return and for the first time am trying to get access to the famous R&amp;D tax credits that help out companies that do innovative stuff. I'm going to pester each of you to see if you feel that you spent a % of your time in 2016 doing a qualifying R&amp;D activity, which is, in short, NOT client work unless you did something they didn't pay for\/get, and generally limited to innovative initiatives that are almost always advancing the state of art of a technology ... activities that advance that state include support activities like supervision, coordination, and alongside activities like design and companion technology, so it is far more about the SUBJECT of the work and less about the way you passed your time. So think about it over the weekend, or hit me up if you have thoughts already. Thaaaaaaanks and have a great weekend!",
