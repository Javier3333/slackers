                "text": "A Georgia Tech student, together with two of his roommates, claims to have hacked Yo, the Poke-like app which has set some of Silicon Valley alight (though not others) in the last 48 hours. [See update below: Yo has confirmed it has been hacked].\nThe student emailed TechCrunch detailing what he alleges is the results of the hack: “We can get any Yo user’s phone number (I actually texted the founder, and he called me back). We can spoof Yo’s from any users, and we can spam any user with as many Yo. We could also send any Yo user a push notification with any text we want (though we decided not to do that).”\nMeanwhile, a Vine video has emerged from Vine user Hako, of the Yo sounding out a snap of ‘Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” instead of it’s normal “Yo!” sound. In other words, what looks to be another hack, though this is not confirmed.\nOther alleged evidence of the hack has emerged, such as this instagram of an iPhone running Yo.\nWe’ve reached out to Yo about this developing story.\nMeanwhile, Yo has other issues. This post by Shubham Datta details how they grabbed the ElonMusk username and set about trying to fool other users they were the real Elon Musk.\nSomehow, Elon Musk himself was led to believe that media figure Jason Calacanis had Yo’d him.\n\nHe now says he is holding the ElonMusk username on Yo in return for a Tesla Model S…\nConfused yet? You will be.\nUPDATE:\nFounder Or Arbel has now confirmed that Yo was “having security issues”.\nHe told TechCrunch: “Some of the stuff has been fixed and some we are still working on. We are taking this very seriously.”\nHe said he could not reveal which hacks were still live. He said the company has brought in a specialist security team to deal with the issues\nArbel said he hoped the security problems would be fixed “in next few hours.”",

A journey from the Poke to the Like, as I was saying only the other day to my co-founder, Roi.\nBut today, I can reveal to you the new app I’m working on and am poised to leave TechCrunch for: Meh.\nYes, Meh may leave you scratching your head. Or scratching something. But Meh is about sending other users a single word: Meh. See? It’s so simple.\nThis contextually-relevant, zeitgeist-capturing experience will target the existentially minded hipster, allowing users to simply and quickly share their little, disinterested shrugs. Their little moments of ‘Hey, I’m just not thinking about you ok?’ kind of moments. Their feelings of ‘Hey, whatever…’\nWe already have tens of active users in the hipster capitals of Shoreditch, the Mission and Kreuzberg. We’ve seen as many as 26 Mehs pass across our servers.\nWhile other apps may be leveraging context, Meh is leveraging something greater than that: complete and utter disinterest. We think this is an untapped resource in social media.\nTime and again people have wanted the Dislike button on Facebook. Today they have that.\nThey have Meh.\nThis isn’t ‘Digital Dualism’. This is ‘Digital Dullism’.\nMeh is about being faster to look cool and disinterested than anyone else.\nCall it Social Grooming for the perpetually unimpressed.\nI’m going to place my bets early: While other such apps will have dropped out of our collective consciousness by next year, Meh is here to stay.\nAnd I’m happy to announce that we’ve already secured $1.8 million in funding, exactly a third more than that other app with the purple logo. Why? I’ll tell you why. We have ONE MORE LETTER, that’s why. Because as of this week, one extra letter gets you a third more funding. Yes. That’s how the Valley rolls.\nMeh is a signal of a larger trend. A trend of Meh.\nBecause a Meh is the new unit of currency for completely stupid startup ideas that win funding off the back of ridiculous, dumb hype from Silicon Valley (sometimes).\nWelcome to Meh. It’s here to stay.\nMeh.",

Today, he designs and builds new products for Spotify in New York, but he couldn’t have predicted that when he dropped out of school at age 15 to work as an apprentice in a computer shop in Austria. He couldn't have predicted that when he applied to graduate schools and design schools and was told repeatedly that he didn't have enough training or talent to build a career. He couldn't have predicted that even when he turned his side passion for visual and product design into a full-time job by opening up his own studio. He didn't know what to expect. But from that point on, side projects have marked his path like bread crumbs, leading him to where he is today. As van Schneider was growing up, teaching himself new skills after work and on weekends, the idea of “side projects” became a foundational myth in the tech world. Products like Gmail, Craigslist, and even Post-Its can trace their roots back to work discovered and developed on the side. As a result, hackathons and other strategies have become standard practice at large companies and even startups to bottle this spirit and keep technical talent engaged. This is great, van Schneider says, but not if it becomes a cliche. His argument: In order for side projects to truly succeed, they have to be stupid. Here’s what he means, and how it can help your company stay creative and competitive: ",
