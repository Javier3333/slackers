By reproducing the same phenomenological conditions upon which the island was seen in 1876, it seeks to reinsert the charting glitch that endured in worldwide maps until 2012. The machine records new datasets that support the further existence of the island by manipulating its digital presence.\n\nThe recorded datasets are available at Sandy Island's open data bank: <http:\/\/thesandyislandreports.net\/>\n\nMore information at: <http:\/\/digitalmedia-bremen.de\/en\/project\/the-new-velocity\/>\n\nPart of the course Hacks and Hoaxes, by Prof. Dennis P.
