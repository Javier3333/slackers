                "text": "Fiona Apple is gearing up for Saturday&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s March on Washington with a new song, titled &ldquo;Tiny Hands.&rdquo;\nThe singer-songwriter teamed up with composer Michael Whalen to create the minute-long track, which Apple recorded on her phone and released Tuesday. The song, which references Donald Trump, is meant to serve as a chant for protesters speaking out against the president-elect, whose inauguration takes place Friday in Washington, D.C.\nSampling Trump&rsquo;s own words from the Access Hollywood tape in which Trump made vulgar comments about women, Apple sings, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want your tiny hands, anywhere near our underpants.&rdquo;\nApple previously attacked Trump during the holiday season in a parody of Nat King Cole&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Christmas Song,&rdquo; with the iconic openings lines altered: &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s nuts roasting on an open fire\/as he keeps nipping at his foes\/You&rsquo;ll cry creepy uncle\/every time he arrives\/for he keeps clawing at your clothes.&rdquo;\nTrump has denied all accusations of sexual assault and misconduct.\nHear the song below.",
