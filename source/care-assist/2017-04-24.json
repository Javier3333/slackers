Rather we can feature the comps, and discuss the latest thinking but not bake them all the way. In particular, I'd like Ali to speak to differentiation between 1:1 context and intervening bot. \n\nWe can then execute on all the designs during our one week sprint.\n\n@elise <@U4VTSDW7P> <@U0XCJ372R> helpful\/accurate?",

Because of this, I think we are in the dark in terms of feasibility, privacy concerns, and mostly whether this interaction model would be annoying\/invasive or well-received. If they choose this option, we could take the next week to sprint on it and map out detailed interaction flows, but I don't have a good grasp on what is within their development scope. Basically, a 1:1 bot seems more straightforward and has a set of \"best practices\" based on what others have tried.",
