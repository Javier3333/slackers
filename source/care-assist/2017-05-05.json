A few times they referred to \"the next time we chat\" and I just want to make sure it's clear that the UX handoff will be in a final delivery state on Monday (and not WIP). Per the discussion, my to-do items are: \n1) Create an intro to the UX documentation that explicitly calls out that this work is just a starting point. Especially relating to tech considerations, we are suggesting examples that will need to be expanded upon (and renaming the triggers section, \"example triggers\")\n2) Ali is adding an annotation in her visual style guide about a collapsed card behavior we discussed\n3) Ada does not give users an option to \"opt\" out of her when she introduces herself--they are automatically opted in. We didn't tie up all the loose ends around how she introduces herself, so I'm calling out that what we are saying is just a suggestion. \n<@U1S5GKTHQ> Does this align with what you saw the next steps to be?",
