Thousands more are probably being designed by inspired teams across the globe as I write these lines. Saying these numbers are mind-blowing would be an understatement. The tech industry's enthusiasm for the bot space is simply unprecedented. Obviously, there have been a fair number of \"fart bots\" goofs -- after all, we're all trying to figure out the space and tinkering is the best way to do so -- but it's been interesting to witness the plethora of new ideas and business models emerging from the early trial-and-error days.",

I’m taken editorial liberties with the chat :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nQ: And I do understand that a big portion of the ask is about the persona\/style of the assistant. That seems intrinsically linked to the 3.0 work which seems like will be finalized _after_ we finish our 5 weeks. So I am curious, because of this timeline, if our work will inform theirs?\n\nA: Yes, 100%. Not only does it inform 3.0 work but also the tone and voice of current 2.0 platform. It’s kind of the Anthropomorphisization of 2.0\n\n Q: Still unclear about what problem we are solving with the  assistant and what it means to design for one \"scenario\"\n\nA: Me too! Part of the scope is, out of all the questions, pinpoints, insights we (+ client) identify (like in our Semiosession) we must choose one, gain consensus and lay out a strategic plan for how the bot can combat this.  v1.0 of bot can’t do much of anything, let alone anything, but what can it do to help?\n\n*I don’t know the answer here, no one does.
