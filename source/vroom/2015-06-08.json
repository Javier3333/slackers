Looks like an old issue - but might be worth addressing simultaneously.\nRedundant Hostnames\nFirst seen time: Oct 8, 2014 6:10:56 AM\nLast seen time: Jun 3, 2015 7:32:30 AM\nProperty Vroom is receiving data from redundant hostnames. Some of the redundant hostnames are: \n\n<http:\/\/joinvroom.org|joinvroom.org>\n<http:\/\/www.joinvroom.org|www.joinvroom.org>\nRedundant hostnames are counted as separate rows in reports, so hits that are going to the same page on your site from different hostnames will be split into multiple rows. With data split across multiple rows, traffic to specific pages will appear lower than it actually is.\n\nTo avoid this problem, consider setting up a 301 redirect from one of your redundant hostnames to the other, or create a search-and-replace filter that strips \"www.\" from hostnames.\nLearn more: <https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/bin\/answer.py?answer=1034834&amp;hl=en_US>",
