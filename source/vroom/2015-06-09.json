        "text": "<@U02688JHZ> bad news about analytics tracking on Vroom. Not only were there no Vroom Groups tracked yesterday, there were no analytics tracked at all. I have found the root issue and fixed it and hope that it’s the only issue. I’m going to retest the method I tried yesterday with one vroom group and retest the previous method using another vroom group and hope that one of those works and I can finish tomorrow. The root bug is unrelated to Vroom groups. My remaining question is how any analytics had been recorded for the previous days. I think it’s because I had so many app versions in different stages.",
