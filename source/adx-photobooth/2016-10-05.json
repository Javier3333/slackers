They’re stuck specifically with swipe payment registering with POS system and releasing photo to customer.  They’ve got a electrical guy and a project manager working on it.  Likely in need of consulting kind of support.\n\nThere is budget.  I’m getting details on that.  They were due to deliver *yesterday* but aren’t feeling too much heat.  <@U02E3CRMA> has a better grip on the nitty gritty and is planning to check it out tomorrow since he’s already scheduled to be at ADX",
