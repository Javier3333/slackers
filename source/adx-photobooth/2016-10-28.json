Leave behind 1 pager.  Firmware needs to handle payment and all permutations; trigger photobooth software.  TESTING AND FINAL DEPLOYMENT ARE OUT OF SCOPE.  I’ll share this understanding with Henry later today when I have the rest of the input I need from ya’ll.  \n\nThe plan:\n- *Today by 4pm:* <@U02E3CRMA> and <@U0EL0GLEL> to list out remaining tasks.  Estimate them\n- We’ll clear availability and plan a sprint.  \n- I’ll share this plan and scope with Henry by EOD.  We’ll then hold ourselves to this delivery date",
