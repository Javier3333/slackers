He doesn't know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth. And in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology text book, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying. ... Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, 'Dude, what's your problem?' The man is utterlly amoral. ... Whatever lie he’s telling, in that minute he believes it. But the man is utterly amoral. Morality does not exist for him. It’s why he went after Heidi [Cruz] directly, attacked her and smeared her. Heidi isn’t pretty enough for him. ... Donald is a bully. ... Bullies don’t come from strength, they come from weakness. ... There’s a reason Donald builds giant buildings and puts his name on them everywhere he goes. ...Donald has a real problem with women\"\"",
