The barbers were even afraid to start a conversation, for fear it would turn to politics.\n \nAs the barbers finished their shaves, the one who had Trump in his chair reached for the aftershave.\n\nTrump was quick to stop him saying, 'No thanks, my wife  will smell that and think I've been in a whorehouse,’\n\nThe second barber turned to Obama and said, 'How about you?'\nObama replied, 'Go ahead, my wife doesn't know what the inside of a whorehouse smells like.'",
