My counter has been on 2 daily actions, which helps focus my media consumption to getting educated:\n1) Reach out to someone daily. Call the State House, Congress, a family member in another district, send a thank you note, contact an organization who can help (e.g. ACLU, SPLC) to find out what actions I can take.\n2) Read the source material for at least 1 issue. The other day, it was the text of the immigration EO (and the annotated version). Once legislation starts hitting the House and Senate committees I want to make sure I'm well-read on the text that's being debated.",
