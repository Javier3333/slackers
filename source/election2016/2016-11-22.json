I’ve always had an uneasy relationship with neoliberalism. Growing up as a teen in the Bush years, I read a lot of radical economic books by the likes of Naomi Klein, John Perkins and more, talking about the problems of neoliberalism (IMF, World Bank, etc). As I grew up though and began to read more and more, I found (find?) understanding at a macroeconomic level what those policies were aiming for at a intellectual level and by extension, almost became a neoliberalist myself. This has been a great tension within myself for that last 8 years and it’s interesting to see that  it is a grand tension playing itself out on the global stage.",
