I asked Kelly via email (cc’d you) for some CAD files for the staircase. I’ll be able to come up with an estimate of how much time is needed to come up with a few ideas after I know if I can use their data or not. Alternatively we can work out another approach of a more collaborative way (us sending sketches to Elk) or a combo of both. Fun stuff :simple_smile:",
