Our goal is to share Chinese home-style dishes (JIĀCHÁNG CÀI) with the people of Portland, using great technique and fresh local ingredients. Our name derives from the place where workers in China, up until the mid-1990’s would eat their meals. Since the members of the work unit came from all over China, the chef needed to be able to not only prepare local dishes but regional specialties as well. Our chef has created a menu which continues this tradition, bringing the best of China to the PDX Danwei.",
