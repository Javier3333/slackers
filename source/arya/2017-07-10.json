I suspect this is because outside the room, the thermostat thinks it's a cool 70. Wonder if there's any way to time particular HVAC systems to be on at points of day. So in this case, in the afternoon that unit kicks on. \n\nI know there's a maze of pipes and systems. Anything we can do to train those systems a bit further?",
