The industry is in its early days, it is a time of exploration and experimentation”\n\n\n<https:\/\/medium.com\/@christauziet\/designing-facebook-spaces-part-1-embarking-on-a-new-vr-journey-a70688da91e1>\n\n\n“I understood this conceptually, but in the beginning I made the mistake of simply transferring 2D thinking into 3D space. That obviously didn’t work well because 3D space has its own unique properties such as a view change (based on user’s head movement) and different requirement for user comfort”\n\n\n<https:\/\/medium.com\/microsoft-design\/taking-the-leap-from-2d-to-3d-4199ccc777a1>",
