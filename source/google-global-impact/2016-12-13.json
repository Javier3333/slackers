These are the points that will inform the conversation.\n\n<https:\/\/docs.google.com\/a\/google.com\/document\/d\/1PE71Yv01xVUmsIc1dJstdZOV6Bw9ETjXLsL8_Zmxsk4\/edit?usp=sharing>\n\nRight now three points I’ve responded to:\n1.  Google wanted to ensure that, while this is web app hosted on AppEngine, that the code would be integrated with Showtime as well.  *I confirmed it would and tagged Joel.*\n2.  Josh thinks that handoff documentation should be more robust than a one sheet and asks if there is more anticipated in a subsequent phase. I’m clarifying: *There are no subsequent phases planned yet and thus no post-launch work identified or associated with subsequent phases.  Given that we’re building an app on existing hardware, the idea is that the project documentation (mocks, TDD etc) we produce + an addendum to the existing Exhibit hardware should suffice since things like power on\/off, exhibit maintenance should already exist in DF documentation. *\n3.  Josh has questions around the progression of our deliverables asking how Motion Study, UI Design and Playtesting happen before TDD.  *My understanding is that the TDD is more of a collation of the produced project documentation.  Meaning we’d need UI design, intended functionality agreed upon before we can codify the TDD deliverable.  Is this of-base given what we learned on Cubby Wall project?*",
