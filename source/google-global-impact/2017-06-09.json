It'd be great if the team here could take a peek at table situation in there and see what might need to be moved\/altered. \n\nOnce tables are arranged appropriately, we're good to set up the rig (assuming we find the boxes that were running it). Monitors are all sitting in the photo studio. I _think_ there's a very strong possibility that the boxes are in the 314 closet.",
