Im trying to eliminate that it is anything that we are doing wrong, and have since came to the conclusion that it cant be anything on our end.

Now If i send a message to show a story, i start to get an infinite loop of that message coming in. I can kill all of the message bindings for the displays and podium and i still can see that the messages are being sent, the one binding left is the one from the showtime qa site. so that is the source of the messages.
