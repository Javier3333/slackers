I suggesst we link to them from the home screen.  \n- <@U02E3CRMA> are you doing the proof point one sheet or is that still with John?\n\nA few other deadlines folks requested clarity around? \n- Tuesday: sending CMS to client for socialization and dogfood.  Needs ot be functional but ok if there are lingering refinements.  \n- Tuesday: <@U0HP6TFNX>  to present CMS to Content Partners \n- Tuesday: Display Designs sent to client\/ready for Dev (will roll in any client comments we accept) \n(It’d be great to send a snap of the Podium as well if we feel confident in it) \n- Thursday AM: Begin Podium dev so wires need to be finalized",

Thanks to John, Megan, Joel, Jason, Justin (in no particularl order) for going all the extra miles!  \n\nWe have a CMS to review with Content Partners at 1.  \n- John’s going to make final changes and update the sheet tomorrow.  *His final deploy is 10am.*  \n- Biggesst priority that I see is the Save Story flow.  Joel can help explain in person as I’m in meetings tomorrow.  \n\nWe have Designs to share with the client at 11!\n\nAccordingly, with all this progress across Design and Dev, I’m trying to re-purpose our Stand Up time to be a Show and Tell.  It’s a bit last minute so it’s possible this moves but I’d like to make it happen. Following this meeting, I have a full plan for all workstreams for tomorrow that I’ll share.\n\nGnight",
