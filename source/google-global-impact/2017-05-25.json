In reply, they wanted to see if we could set some time up to chat about some updates they've made to the exhibit as well as some 2.0 hopes they have. \n\nI don't have a ton more detail at this point, though I think that's what the meeting is for.  Any and all are welcome, though at this early stage think everybody is optional attendance. \n\nLet me know any questions\/concerns you might have. Thanks!",
