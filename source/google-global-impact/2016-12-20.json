Armed with these, the goal of the meeting will be to answer the questions:\n-How do we work next week? What do we want the cadence of check-ins to be? What sorts of artifact dependencies exist?\n-How close can we be to defined templates, defined content types, defined data models and wireframes (for podium) by 01\/03?",

If we were to use it it would be a completely canned experience, there wouldnt be a search. it would be we need this data to drive the experience. and what is that. someone input this data head of time and we will just display it. There is no search, we already have the data we need. Its very static. We will need a cms even if its a basic form input to a datastore. And there is no requirement that this admin lives in showtime. There would be a link to it, but iframe is over kill and completely unneeded. and no data from our cms would go back into the show for the run of show. Im writing this up in more detail in the software doc, can discuss more tomorrow",
