In todays, stand-up, we had a mix of more high-level product strategy discussions (e.g. tag generated stories and the algo to generate them) and specific next steps (artifacts generated for client kickoff tomorrow). Regarding the immediate next steps, those include an effort by <@U0HP6TFNX> to flush out a bit more structural information (e.g. tagging structure, content guide) and by the design team to assemble the kickoff artifacts into something like a deck for tomorrow. We are also asking for data visualization needs For the rest of the notes, please check here and please let me know if you have any questions. <https:\/\/docs.google.com\/a\/uncorkedstudios.com\/document\/d\/1apPQAsNB18XiPNx-WunvDYS5POmkA9l8m1GKiZvCQUo\/edit?usp=sharing>",

We could limit their options this way, or prescribe very specific sizes and colors to be used and remove the customization. etc…",

There are some options in here for animations but that is where things start to look more complicated, will need to look into it a little more as to how you would even use it if animations were involved. static files isnt too bad they can be generated and saved, using the system for animations is a totally different game. the api must be called and the output rendered directly not saved to the bucket. which means iframe will be used, also it says there is only support for on show of the chart, and change of the data for animations. these are just considerations that would need to be considered here too. not sure its something that precludes it tho",
