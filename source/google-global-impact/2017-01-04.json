I think the urls for the media would need to have some kind of qualifier attached, image, chart, video, whatever. so they load into the right template for display. But they would certainly be available to either parent or child objects in the data. dont think that part has any bearing. The any animation would fire upon display of that chart on the screen. or if the data was changed. The animations themselves are fairly prescribed, being a set style for each chart, but looks like you can change things like time length and ease. There are lots of options for customizing the charts it looks like, on a per chart basis. Looking at bar charts for example there is a whole section on them being more material, <https:\/\/developers.google.com\/chart\/interactive\/docs\/gallery\/barchart#creating-material-bar-charts>",
