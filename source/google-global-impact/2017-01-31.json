The text that we want to transition in always flows line by line. this becomes a problem since the label block of data would be all one line. This is all one line and wouldn’t be changed esspecially on areas like attract mode when the data is not curated to fix that exact contraints of that area. in other words the line would not be broken into multiple lines and each line animate on their own, this breaks the transiitons I seen proposed. But what I did figure out was a way to grab the current style sheet, do some math on where that text will be placed, and figure out the character width of the parent its going into, then the line is broken up into words that fit into that parent container contraint. Now each line is its own object and this individual line animation transition can happen. I will not have logical control over breaking in one place over another tho, and Its just a size contraint break. This would be mostly evident again on the attract, since that data is being reused there, not curated for that area form the start like it would possibly be for if that data was on a display. tldr, your fancy line tranistion ins and outs will work <@U0J6TE0CA>",
