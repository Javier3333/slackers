The training content creation flows are great and the visuals with multiple projectors installed in a restaurant really demonstrate the potential for multiple units in a single restaurant. If we can really deliver on the concepts you outlined I can really see this improving training systems to the point of everyone being trained the same way at every restaurant which would have huge benefits in consistency across brands.  Iâ€™m getting more and more excited about this project.  Thanks for your hard work.\"",

Also, full budget is still around $200-250K for making a real POC? Have we done any scoping to work out a back-napkin of what it would take to make what we showed?",
