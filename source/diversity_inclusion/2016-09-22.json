Do I voice my support or is it counter-productive because I have no right to talk about something that doesn’t affect me? Do I march in the Black Lives Matter protests going on around my campus (note: I did). How do I help without imposing myself on a culture that I’m not a part of? I found the following website (as well as Just Mercy (note: this is like my 18th shameless plug for that book)) very helpful in educating myself. I hope that some of the rest of you might as well. Disclaimer: I have not read all of the articles linked here. However, I have found the ones that I have incredibly informative and helpful in bringing awareness to my own blind spots.\n\n<http:\/\/citizenshipandsocialjustice.com\/2015\/07\/10\/curriculum-for-white-americans-to-educate-themselves-on-race-and-racism\/>",
