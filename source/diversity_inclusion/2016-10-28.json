I'm on both sides of this one. I LOVE AMY SCHUMER. I have seen every episode of her show, every joke on stand up, I'm reading her book currently. I identify with her a lot. Like a lot of us, Amy could use some help identifying her blind spots but her intentions were clearly good. We talked earlier about how intentions are NOT an excuse and I still agree with that. But I also think that particular article (and actually many of them) are harsh. Amy Schumer idolizes Beyonce in the same way many of us do. It feels like an amateur video that I might make with my friends in homage to Beyonce and her amazingness.",
