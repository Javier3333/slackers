                "text": "In the Bible, Eve is created to serve Adam. &amp;ldquo;It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him,&amp;rdquo; muses God in Genesis 2:18. \nTwenty-first-century office culture is no exception. More than 3,000 years later, the word &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo; is used all the time&amp;mdash;particularly in reference to the work that women do.\nIn November, ex-Gawker writer Dayna Evans published a Medium post alleging insidious sexism at the publication. In a memo announcing the hire of editor-in-chief Alex Pareene, interim editor-in-chief Leah Beckmann&amp;rsquo;s is characterized in the following way:\nLeah Beckmann deserves the gratitude and respect of all of us for stepping up as acting editor-in-chief of Gawker during a goddamned horrible time for the site&amp;rsquo;s staff&amp;hellip;.Please thank her for stepping into the breach and helping out.\nWhen a man edits, it&amp;rsquo;s called work. When a woman does, she&amp;rsquo;s helping out.\nI&amp;rsquo;ve heard it countless times, even from coworkers I consider attuned to gender equality. Once, as I was leaving a previous job, the CEO sent me an email thanking me for all of my help. It might be a slip of the tongue, but it makes genuine appreciation sound dismissive and a woman&amp;rsquo;s effort seem quaint.\nIt&amp;rsquo;s not just journalism. In February, Adam Grant and Sheryl Sandberg wrote in the New York Times that women often take a gendered role of &amp;ldquo;office housework&amp;rdquo; in corporate settings:\nThis is the sad reality in workplaces around the world: Women help more but benefit less from it. In keeping with deeply held gender stereotypes, we expect men to be ambitious and results-oriented, and women to be nurturing and communal. When a man offers to help, we shower him with praise and rewards. But when a woman helps, we feel less indebted. She&amp;rsquo;s communal, right? She wants to be a team player. The reverse is also true. When a woman declines to help a colleague, people like her less and her career suffers. But when a man says no, he faces no backlash. A man who doesn&amp;rsquo;t help is &amp;ldquo;busy&amp;rdquo;; a woman is &amp;ldquo;selfish.&amp;rdquo;\nI&amp;rsquo;m talking about situations where women are paid for the work they do. I&amp;rsquo;m all for a spirit of collaboration and generosity. But when it&amp;rsquo;s in a professional context, &amp;ldquo;helping&amp;rdquo; your colleagues or manager or reporters is by definition work.\nThe words we use matter. And the way we describe work affects how we think about it. Thinking of women&amp;rsquo;s work as &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo; might be one of the reasons with why there&amp;rsquo;s still a gender pay gap in the US, not to mention severe underrepresentation of women in leadership positions across industries. \nAs Soraya Chemaly wrote for Quartz earlier this year: &amp;ldquo;The message that women&amp;rsquo;s time and work is inherently less valuable than that of their male peers&amp;rsquo; is a systemic one.&amp;rdquo; Do us all a favor and keep thanking colleagues for their work, their ideas, even their attitudes. But never for their help.",
