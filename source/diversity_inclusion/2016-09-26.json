        "text": "Recently I stopped by Powell’s and picked up the book Hyperbole and a Half (which I highly recommend, it had me laughing out loud in the bookstore) but it also had a few really valuable chapters on depression. I have never been depressed but I have had a lot of friends that have. My high school has had 5 suicides in the past 3 years, making my hometown have the highest suicide rate in the country. In college, many of my good friends battled with depression and I found it really hard to relate with them or know what to do. I want to be a resource for them but I was afraid my excess positivity and optimism was hurting more than helping. The two chapters from Hyperbole and a Half gave me the perspective I was missing. Depression, in those two chapters (with pictures!) is explained with very good analogies and expressed in a way that I could really understand and helped me start to understand my role as an ally. I want to share it with you guys. It’s a really quick read (probably quicker than this extra long explanation I’m writing here) and it may help you realize your blind spots as well. I full acknowledge that everybody’s experience with depression is different and so this may not full encompass it but I really recommend giving this a read. \nChapter 1: <http:\/\/hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com\/2011\/10\/adventures-in-depression.html>\nChapter 2: <http:\/\/hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com\/2013\/05\/depression-part-two.html>",
