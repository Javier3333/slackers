It sort of breaks my heart to think that someone here might be facing something and would self-censor for fear of making someone uncomfortable. Further, I don’t ever want someone to feel like in order to bring something up they also need to have a solution. For me, I want people to feel like UCS is place where one can simply say “this is a thing I’m seeing, or feeling, or thinking” without worry that their experience is putting someone else out. The reality is that if you’ve (me) been privileged enough in this life to not face discrimination or hostility or repression than you (me) likely don’t have a fully developed vocabulary to address these issues immediately, which is what makes it uncomfortable, and what makes it critical that we get more comfortable being uncomfortable.",
