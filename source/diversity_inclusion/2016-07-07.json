Here’s the deal: \n\nAfter attending diversity and inclusion workshops offered by the PDC we wanted to keep the momentum going at Uncorked, and formed the DC. This committee is meant to be open to anyone who wants to join, and your level of participation is completely up to you (i.e. join for one meeting and not the next). The committee will be responsible for proposing policy changes, planning events, and generally talking about what diversity and inclusion means to Uncorked. \n\nOur next meeting is Wed July 13th where we’ll be planning our very first workshop. The focus of the workshop is going to be getting the official Uncorked Diversity and Inclusion mission statement written up, and it’s happening July 19th. We’d love to have as many of you as possible join in to the committee and the workshop!",
