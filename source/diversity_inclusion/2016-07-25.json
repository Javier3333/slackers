Stay engaged:*  Staying engaged means “remaining morally, emotionally, intellectually, and socially involved in the dialogue”\n\n*2. Experience discomfort:*  This norm acknowledges that discomfort is inevitable, especially, in dialogue about race, and that participants make a commitment to bring issues into the open.  It is not talking about these issues that create divisiveness.  The divisiveness already exists in the society and in our schools.  It is through dialogue, even when uncomfortable, the healing and change begin.\n\n*3. Speak your truth:*  This means being open about thoughts and feelings and not just saying what you think others want to hear.\n\n*4. Expect and accept nonclosure:*  This agreement asks participants to “hang out in uncertainty” and not rush to quick solutions, especially in relation to racial understanding, which requires ongoing dialogue.",
