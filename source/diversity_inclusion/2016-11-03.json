The top right quadrant is the goal. But we had quite a few items in the lower left quadrant. We came to the conclusion that, while it is difficult to affect change on the x axis (though that doesn't mean we should stop trying), it is up to us to improve the y axis. The three areas we could really improve upon were age, religion, and politics. Curious to hear what people have to say about those particular areas. We thought that the best way to improve upon that is to make dialogue about those areas more open.",
