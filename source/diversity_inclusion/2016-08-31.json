Within 8 months we have achieved first close of not one but two funds and invested in 6 amazing startups from both the elevate inclusive fund (six startups) of which two received funding from elevate capital fund... 50% are founded by women and the six are diverse and multi colored. THE UNITED COLORS OF BENETTON!  I am so proud of my team, especially Eric Booth. Not only have we been raising capital, we have been working hard to find the brightest and the best to invest in. Warm  to our mentors and the elevate investment cohort #1. Now lets go change the world;  and make some money doing that - TOGETHER! Namaste Nitin Rai For Immediate Release Elevate Capital announces first close of its two funds and cohort of investments in women and minority owned startups    Portland, OR (August 31, 2016) – Elevate Capital announced that it has completed the first close of its $3 million Elevate Inclusive Fund and $10 million Elevate Capital Fund and has made investments in its first cohort of six women and minority entrepreneur-led startups. Elevate Capital is a Pacific Northwest-based venture firm that invests in early stage under-represented entrepreneurs, including women and minorities that include communities of color, veterans, and entrepreneurs located in under-served regions. Elevate Capital, Oregon Governor Kate Brown, Multnomah County Commissioner Loretta Smith, and Kimberly Branam, Portland Development Commission (PDC) Executive Director, along with other investors in both funds, will recognize and showcase these investments at a media and investor-only showcase event on August 31, 2016 at the Oregon Story Board. “Seventy percent of Oregon’s new jobs happen when existing businesses grow and expand,” Governor Kate Brown said. “Promising businesses owned by Oregonians in underserved communities need and deserve access to investment capital to help them grow, and Elevate Capital’s announcement of these first six recipients is proof that entrepreneurship is alive and well in all Oregon communities.” \"I am truly elated to see this idea come to fruition and celebrate the first six recipients of the Elevate Inclusive Fund,” said Loretta Smith, Multnomah County Commissioner. “This is a key example of how we can foster wealth creation within our communities of color and low-income neighborhoods and get us closer to becoming an even more competitive and equitable place for folks to live and work.\" “We’re very proud of our role in seeding the Elevate Inclusive Fund as one of the first investment funds in the nation to support inclusion and diversity,” said Kimberly Branam, PDC Executive Director. “Our number one question at PDC is “who benefits?” And in this case it is small, entrepreneurial endeavors, led by diverse founders, with the potential to become much larger players in our regional economy.” Investors in the Elevate Inclusive Fund were led by a $250,000 commitment from the State of Oregon, $500,000 from Multnomah County, and $500,000 from Portland Development Commission, as well as additional investments were raised both from in and out-of-state entrepreneurs.  Elevate Capital closed on its $4.2 million investment that was led by a $2 million investment from Meyer Memorial Trust, $250,000 from Oregon Community Foundation, and individual investors such as local entrepreneur Steven Marsh who invested in both funds, and certain members of the TiE Oregon Angels and Willamette Angels Group.  Both funds are on a rolling close till first half of 2017. \"We are happy to see Elevate Capital has completed its first close. Meyer Memorial Trust is excited to find a new partner focused on investing in under-represented and underserved communities, including communities of color,\" said Rukaiyah Adams, Meyer Memorial Trust Chief Investment Officer. “I’m excited to be able to support Elevate Capital and the great companies they’re helping to find capital, expertise, and other resources they need to be successful,” said Steven Marsh. Elevate Capital is investing $25,000-$75,000 in early seed investments from its Inclusive Fund and up to $500,000 in seed and series A stage type investments from the Capital fund. It will have additional funds available for follow-on investments from both funds. “We are off to a great start! I am delighted that we have achieved this milestone so quickly and I am very thankful for the overwhelming support we have received from our investors and the community at large,” said Nitin Rai, Managing Director of Elevate Capital. “Not only have we been working hard to raise capital, we have been simultaneously managing an overwhelming interest from entrepreneurs to seek capital from our funds.
