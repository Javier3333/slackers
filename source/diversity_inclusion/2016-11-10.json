I’m putting two books in the library that I’ve been meaning to bring in.\n1) Live Through This: On Creativity and Self-Destruction\n - This is a really painful but powerful read. It is a compilation of short essays by creatives, writing about their experiences of self-destruction (e.g. self-harm, addiction, eating disorders).\n2) Dear Jenny, We Are All Find\n- This is a book of poetry by Jenny Zhang, a Chinese American poet based in New York. A lot of her poetry and writing focuses on her experiences as a Chinese American woman.",
