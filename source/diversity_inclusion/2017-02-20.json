Diversifying our workforce to include all from our community is the right thing to do, and the data shows it benefits us in terms of innovation, team functioning, and bottom line results. We know that greater diversity leads to greater innovation. Tech + Inclusion Community Conversation is an opportunity for companies who have joined the PDC Diversity Pledge and the community to come together. This event is open to those working in the tech sector, to students and prospective tech sector workers, and those interested in working in the tech industry. The Tech + Inclusion event will help create partnerships that assist in hiring and career advancement of women and people of color in Portland’s Tech industry.
